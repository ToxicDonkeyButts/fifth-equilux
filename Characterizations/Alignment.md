# Alignment

A typical creature in the game world has an alignment, which broadly describes its moral and personal attitudes.

**Lawful:** Can be counted on to do the right thing. 

**Neutral:** Prefer to steer clear of moral questions and don't take sides, doing what seems best at the time.

**Chaotic:** Do whatever they can get away with, without compassion or qualms. Act with arbitrary violence, spurred by their greed, hatred, or bloodlust.
