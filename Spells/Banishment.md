### Banishment

*4th-level abjuration*

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (an item distasteful to the target)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You attempt to send one creature that you can see within range to the moon. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be banished.

The target is banished with a faint popping noise, returning to its home. If the spell ends before 1 minute has passed, the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied. Otherwise, the target doesn't return.

***At Higher Levels***. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 4th.
