# Fifth Equilux (5E)

A trimmed down version of the worlds most popular drakes and depths game.
Trying to make it work for an OSR gaming experience while maintainig familiarity with the majority of the current player base.

## Design goals:

The main focus should be to firstly **REMOVE content**, second **CHANGE mechanics** and lastly **ADD procedures**.

The document should end up with less stuff than what we started with.

## Changes:

- [] Cantrips have been turned into 1st-level spells as to make dungeon delving resource mannagement an experience to be had. Being able to cast ex. Light over and over again from 1st-level just crushes soo many assumptions of OSR gaming.
- [] Classes have been cut back to Cleric, Figther and Wizard. The variety should come from the lived experiences of the characters and the stuff they pick up before they perish.
- [] Darkvision have been changed to Infravision. As with the cantrips, having an alternative to an actual light source that isn't going to dry out isn't going to cut it.
- [] Cleric and wizard spells go no higher than 6th-level. This is before we encounter planar travel spells.
- [] Do somehting about rests. Long as well as short.
- [] Do something about Experience gain. XP to Gold should be the standard.
- [] Remove Inspiration.
- [] Remove Multiclassing.
- [] Remove Feats.
- [] Slim down Alignment.
- [] Slim down Languages.
