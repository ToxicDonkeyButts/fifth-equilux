<p>If a situation arises where your characters previous life might add
some kind of benefit, bring it forth and the GM might have you just
overcome the situation or grant you advantage. In the same way the GM
might apply disadvantage to a situation if the characters background has
implications. As a farmer you would know how long it would take for a
besiged fort to run out of food and give in. As a noble stripped of
title you might find it difficult to blend in with high society and stay
unrecognized.</p>
<h2 id="choose-languages">Choose Languages</h2>
<p>Your characters race provides two languages. For demi-humans (Dwarf,
Elf and Halfling) it’s their native tongue and the Common language. For
humans it’s Common and one extra language from the language table or
additional languages provided by the GM:</p>

<h2 id="pick-an-alignment">Pick an Alignment</h2>
<p>Your character can either be <strong>Lawful</strong> or
<strong>Neutral</strong>. Lawful being your common man or adventurer and
Neutral being your outlaw, thief or others who do not agree that the
rules are meant for them. Monsterns and other dungeon denizens who might
enjoy the taste of human flesh are considered <strong>Chaotic</strong>
alignment. Commit enough atrocities and you might end up having the GM
ask you to switch your alignment.</p>
<h2 id="choose-equipment">Choose Equipment</h2>
<p>Your choice of class provides your character with equipment and
starting wealth. You can’t sell the starting equipment but you are
allowed to spend your gold buying additional equipment before play
begins.</p>
<h1 id="dwarf">Dwarf</h1>
<h3 id="dwarf-traits">Dwarf Traits</h3>
<p>Your dwarf character has an assortment of inborn abilities, part and
parcel of dwarven nature. Most dwarves are lawful, believing firmly in
the benefits of a well-ordered society. They tend toward good as well,
with a strong sense of fair play and a belief that everyone deserves to
share in the benefits of a just order. As a dwarf, you have keen senses,
deep intuition, and remarkable resilience.</p>
<p><strong><em>Ability Score Increase</em></strong>. Your Constitution
score increases by 2 and your Wisdom score increases by 1.</p>
<p><strong><em>Age</em></strong>. Dwarves mature at the same rate as
humans, but they’re considered young until they reach the age of 50. On
average, they live about 350 years.</p>
<p><strong><em>Size</em></strong>. Dwarves stand between 4 and 5 feet
tall and average about 150 pounds. Your size is Medium.</p>
<p><strong><em>Speed</em></strong>. Your base walking speed is 25 feet.
Your speed is not reduced by wearing heavy armor.</p>
<p><strong><em>Darkvision</em></strong>. Accustomed to life underground,
you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim
light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness
as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness and you
can’t read because fine details are impossible to make out. Visible
light sources (torches, candles, lanterns) prevents darkvision from
functioning.</p>
<p><strong><em>Dwarven Resilience</em></strong>. You have advantage on
saving throws against poison, and you have resistance against poison
damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Dwarven Combat Training</em></strong>. You have
proficiency with the battleaxe, handaxe, light hammer, and
warhammer.</p>
<p><strong><em>Dwarven Toughness</em></strong>. Your hit point maximum
increases by 1, and it increases by 1 every time you gain a level.</p>
<p><strong><em>Tool Proficiency</em></strong>. You gain proficiency with
the artisan’s tools of your choice: smith’s tools, brewer’s supplies, or
mason’s tools.</p>
<p><strong><em>Stonecunning</em></strong>. Whenever you make an
Intelligence (History) check related to the origin of stonework, you are
considered proficient in the History skill and add double your
proficiency bonus to the check, instead of your normal proficiency
bonus.</p>
<p><strong><em>Languages</em></strong>. You can speak, read, and write
Common and Dwarvish. Dwarvish is full of hard consonants and guttural
sounds, and those characteristics spill over into whatever other
language a dwarf might speak. # Elf</p>
<h3 id="elf-traits">Elf Traits</h3>
<p>Your elf character has a variety of natural abilities, the result of
thousands of years of elven refinement. Elves love freedom, variety, and
self- expression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler aspects of
chaos. They value and protect others’ freedom as well as their own, and
they are more often good than not.</p>
<p><strong><em>Ability Score Increase</em></strong>. Your Dexterity
score increases by 2 and you Intelligence increases by 1.</p>
<p><strong><em>Age</em></strong>. Although elves reach physical maturity
at about the same age as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood
goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf
typically claims adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and
can live to be 750 years old.</p>
<p><strong><em>Size</em></strong>. Elves range from under 5 to over 6
feet tall and have slender builds. Your size is Medium.</p>
<p><strong><em>Speed</em></strong>. Your base walking speed is 30
feet.</p>
<p><strong><em>Darkvision</em></strong>. Accustomed to twilit forests
and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions.
You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright
light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color
in darkness and you can’t read because fine details are impossible to
make out. Visible light sources (torches, candles, lanterns) prevents
darkvision from functioning.</p>
<p><strong><em>Keen Senses</em></strong>. You have proficiency in the
Perception skill.</p>
<p><strong><em>Fey Ancestry</em></strong>. You have advantage on saving
throws against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep.</p>
<p><strong><em>Elf Weapon Training</em></strong>. You have proficiency
with the longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.</p>
<p><strong><em>Spell</em></strong>. You know one 1st-level spell of your
choice from the wizard spell list. Intelligence is your spellcasting
ability for it.</p>
<p><strong><em>Trance</em></strong>. Elves don’t need to sleep. Instead,
they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The
Common word for such meditation is “trance.”) While meditating, you can
dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that
have become reflexive through years of practice.</p>
<p>After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human
does from 8 hours of sleep.</p>
<p><strong><em>Languages</em></strong>. You can speak, read, and write
Common and Elvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and
intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, and their songs
and poems are famous among other races. Many bards learn their language
so they can add Elvish ballads to their repertoires.</p>
<h1 id="halfling">Halfling</h1>
<h3 id="halfling-traits">Halfling Traits</h3>
<p>As a rule, haflings are good-hearted and kind, hate to see others in
pain, and have no tolerance for oppression. They are also very orderly
and traditional, leaning heavily on the support of their community and
the comfort of their old ways. As a halfling, you can easily hide from
notice, even using other people as cover. You’re inclined to be affable
and get along well with others.</p>
<p><strong><em>Ability Score Increase</em></strong>. Your Dexterity
score increases by 2 and your Charisma score increases by 1.</p>
<p><strong><em>Age</em></strong>. A halfling reaches adulthood at the
age of 20 and generally lives into the middle of his or her second
century.</p>
<p><strong><em>Size</em></strong>. Halflings average about 3 feet tall
and weigh about 40 pounds. Your size is Small.</p>
<p><strong><em>Speed</em></strong>. Your base walking speed is 25
feet.</p>
<p><strong><em>Lucky</em></strong>. When you roll a 1 on the d20 for an
attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can reroll the die and
must use the new roll.</p>
<p><strong><em>Brave</em></strong>. You have advantage on saving throws
against being frightened.</p>
<p><strong><em>Halfling Nimbleness</em></strong>. You can move through
the space of any creature that is of a size larger than yours.</p>
<p><strong><em>Naturally Stealthy</em></strong>. You can attempt to hide
even when you are obscured only by a creature that is at least one size
larger than you.</p>
<p><strong><em>Languages</em></strong>. You can speak, read, and write
Common and Halfling. The Halfling language isn’t secret, but halflings
are loath to share it with others. They write very little, so they don’t
have a rich body of literature. Their oral tradition, however, is very
strong. Almost all halflings speak Common to converse with the people in
whose lands they dwell or through which they are traveling.</p>
<h1 id="human">Human</h1>
<h3 id="human-traits">Human Traits</h3>
<p>It’s hard to make generalizations about humans, but your human
character has these traits.</p>
<p><strong><em>Ability Score Increase</em></strong>. Your ability scores
each increase by 1.</p>
<p><strong><em>Age</em></strong>. Humans reach adulthood in their late
teens and live less than a century.</p>
<p><strong><em>Size</em></strong>. Humans vary widely in height and
build, from barely 5 feet to well over 6 feet tall. Regardless of your
position in that range, your size is Medium.</p>
<p><strong><em>Speed</em></strong>. Your base walking speed is 30
feet.</p>
<p><strong><em>Languages</em></strong>. You can speak, read, and write
Common and one extra language of your choice. Humans typically learn the
languages of other peoples they deal with, including obscure dialects.
They are fond of sprinkling their speech with words borrowed from other
tongues: Orc curses, Elvish musical expressions, Dwarvish military
phrases, and so on. # Cleric</p>

<h3 id="spellcasting">Spellcasting</h3>
<p>As a conduit for divine power, you can cast cleric spells.</p>
<h4 id="preparing-and-casting-spells">Preparing and Casting Spells</h4>
<p>The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your
cleric spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you
must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all
expended spell slots when you finish a rest.</p>
<p>You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to
cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a
number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric
level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which
you have spell slots.</p>
<p>For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 1st-level
and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of
prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any
combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <em>cure wounds</em>,
you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell
doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>
<p>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a rest.
Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and
meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your
list.</p>
<h4 id="spellcasting-ability">Spellcasting Ability</h4>
<p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power
of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your
Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In
addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC
for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
<p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your
Wisdom modifier</p>
<p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus +
your Wisdom modifier</p>
<h4 id="ritual-casting">Ritual Casting</h4>
<p>You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual
tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>
<h4 id="spellcasting-focus">Spellcasting Focus</h4>
<p>You can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your cleric
spells.</p>
<h3 id="channel-divinity">Channel Divinity</h3>
<p>At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly
from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects and Turn
Undead.</p>
<p>When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to
create. You must then finish a rest to use your Channel Divinity
again.</p>
<p>Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use
such an effect from this class, the DC equals your cleric spell save
DC.</p>
<p>Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice
between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times
between rests. When you finish a rest, you regain your expended
uses.</p>
<h4 id="channel-divinity-turn-undead">Channel Divinity: Turn Undead</h4>
<p>As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer
censuring the undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30
feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its
saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any
damage.</p>
<p>A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away
from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30
feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use
only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it
from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge
action.</p>
<h4 id="channel-divinity-preserve-life">Channel Divinity: Preserve
Life</h4>
<p>As an action, you present your holy symbol and evoke healing energy
that can restore a number of hit points equal to five times your cleric
level. Choose any creatures within 30 feet of you, and divide those hit
points among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than
half of its hit point maximum. You can’t use this feature on an undead
or a construct.</p>
<h3 id="ability-score-improvement">Ability Score Improvement</h3>
<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th
level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you
can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you
can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>
<h3 id="destroy-undead">Destroy Undead</h3>
<p>Starting at 5th level, when an undead fails its saving throw against
your Turn Undead feature, the creature is instantly destroyed if its
challenge rating is at or below a certain threshold, as shown in the
Destroy Undead table.</p>

<h3 id="blessed-healer">Blessed Healer</h3>
<p>Beginning at 6th level, the healing spells you cast on others heal
you as well. When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that restores
hit points to a creature other than you, you regain hit points equal to
2 + the spell’s level.</p>
<h3 id="divine-strike">Divine Strike</h3>
<p>At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with
divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a
weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 radiant
damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage
increases to 2d8.</p>
<h3 id="divine-intervention">Divine Intervention</h3>
<p>Beginning at 10th level, you can call on your deity to intervene on
your behalf when your need is great.</p>
<p>Imploring your deity’s aid requires you to use your action. Describe
the assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number
equal to or lower than your cleric level, your deity intervenes. The GM
chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any cleric spell
would be appropriate.</p>
<p>If your deity intervenes, you can’t use this feature again for 7
days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a rest.</p>
<p>At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, no
roll required.</p>
<h3 id="supreme-healing">Supreme Healing</h3>
<p>Starting at 17th level, when you would normally roll one or more dice
to restore hit points with a spell, you instead use the highest number
possible for each die. For example, instead of restoring 2d6 hit points
to a creature, you restore 12. # Fighter</p>
<h2 id="class-features-1">Class Features</h2>
<p>As a fighter, you gain the following class features.</p>
<h3 id="hit-points-1">Hit Points</h3>
<p><strong>Hit Dice:</strong> 1d10 per fighter level</p>
<p><strong>Hit Points at 1st Level:</strong> 10 + your Constitution
modifier</p>
<p><strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</strong> 1d10 (or 6) + your
Constitution modifier per fighter level after 1st</p>
<h3 id="proficiencies-1">Proficiencies</h3>

<h3 id="spellcasting-1">Spellcasting</h3>
<p>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells
that show the first glimmerings of your true power.</p>
<h4 id="spellbook">Spellbook</h4>
<p>At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st- level wizard
spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard
spells you know.</p>
<h4 id="preparing-and-casting-spells-1">Preparing and Casting
Spells</h4>
<p>The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your
wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you
must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all
expended spell slots when you finish a rest.</p>
<p>You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to
cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook
equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one
spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell
slots.</p>
<p>For example, if you’re a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level
and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of
prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any
combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level
spell <em>magic missile</em>, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a
2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of
prepared spells.</p>
<p>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a rest.
Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your
spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to
cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your
list.</p>
<h4 id="spellcasting-ability-1">Spellcasting Ability</h4>
<p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells,
since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization.
You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting
ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting
the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an
attack roll with one.</p>
<p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your
Intelligence modifier</p>
<p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus +
your Intelligence modifier</p>
<h4 id="ritual-casting-1">Ritual Casting</h4>
<p>You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual
tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don’t need to have the
spell prepared.</p>
<h4 id="spellcasting-focus-1">Spellcasting Focus</h4>
<p>You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your wizard
spells.</p>
<h4 id="learning-spells-of-1st-level-and-higher">Learning Spells of 1st
Level and Higher</h4>
<p>Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of
your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of
a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On
your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your
spellbook.</p>
<h3 id="school-of-magic">School of Magic</h3>
<p>When you reach 2nd level, and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level, you
can select a school of magic. Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination,
Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy or Transmutation. The gold
and time you must spend to copy a spell of that school into your
spellbook is halved.</p>
<h3 id="ability-score-improvement-2">Ability Score Improvement</h3>
<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th
level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you
can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you
can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>
<h3 id="spell-mastery">Spell Mastery</h3>
<p>At 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain spells
that you can cast them at will. Choose a 1st-level wizard spell and a
2nd-level wizard spell that are in your spellbook. You can cast those
spells at their lowest level without expending a spell slot when you
have them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level,
you must expend a spell slot as normal.</p>
<p>By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the
spells you chose for different spells of the same levels.</p>
<h3 id="signature-spells">Signature Spells</h3>
<p>When you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful spells
and can cast them with little effort. Choose two 3rd-level wizard spells
in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have these spells
prepared, they don’t count against the number of spells you have
prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 3rd level without
expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can’t do so again until you
finish a rest.</p>
<p>If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a
spell slot as normal.</p>
<h1 id="beyond-1st-level">Beyond 1st Level</h1>
<p>As your character goes on adventures and overcomes challenges, he or
she gains experience, represented by experience points. A character who
reaches a specified experience point total advances in capability. This
advancement is called <strong>gaining a level</strong>.</p>
<p>When your character gains a level, his or her class often grants
additional features, as detailed in the class description. Some of these
features allow you to increase your ability scores, either increasing
two scores by 1 each or increasing one score by 2. You can’t increase an
ability score above 20. In addition, every character’s proficiency bonus
increases at certain levels.</p>
<p>Each time you gain a level, you gain 1 additional Hit Die. Roll that
Hit Die, add your Constitution modifier to the roll, and add the total
to your hit point maximum. Alternatively, you can use the fixed value
shown in your class entry, which is the average result of the die roll
(rounded up).</p>
<p>When your Constitution modifier increases by 1, your hit point
maximum increases by 1 for each level you have attained. For example, if
your 7th-­‐‑level fighter has a Constitution score of 17, when he reaches
8th level, he increases his Constitution score from 17 to 18, thus
increasing his Constitution modifier from +3 to +4. His hit point
maximum then increases by 8.</p>
<p>The Character Advancement table summarizes the XP you need to advance
in levels from level 1 through level 20, and the proficiency bonus for a
character of that level. Consult the information in your character’s
class description to see what other improvements you gain at each
level.</p>

<h1 id="selling-treasure">Selling Treasure</h1>
<p>Opportunities abound to find treasure, equipment, weapons, armor, and
more in the dungeons you explore. Normally, you can sell your treasures
and trinkets when you return to a town or other settlement, provided
that you can find buyers and merchants interested in your loot.</p>
<p><strong><em>Arms, Armor, and Other Equipment</em></strong>. As a
general rule, undamaged weapons, armor, and other equipment fetch half
their cost when sold in a market. Weapons and armor used by monsters are
rarely in good enough condition to sell.</p>
<p><strong><em>Magic Items</em></strong>. Selling magic items is
problematic. Finding someone to buy a potion or a scroll isn’t too hard,
but other items are out of the realm of most but the wealthiest nobles.
Likewise, aside from a few common magic items, you won’t normally come
across magic items or spells to purchase. The value of magic is far
beyond simple gold and should always be treated as such.</p>
<p><strong><em>Gems, Jewelry, and Art Objects</em></strong>. These items
retain their full value in the marketplace, and you can either trade
them in for coin or use them as currency for other transactions. For
exceptionally valuable treasures, the GM might require you to find a
buyer in a large town or larger community first.</p>
<p><strong><em>Trade Goods</em></strong>. On the borderlands, many
people conduct transactions through barter. Like gems and art objects,
trade goods-bars of iron, bags of salt, livestock, and so on-retain
their full value in the market and can be used as currency. # Armor</p>
<p>Fantasy gaming worlds are a vast tapestry made up of many different
cultures, each with its own technology level. For this reason,
adventurers have access to a variety of armor types, ranging from
leather armor to chain mail to costly plate armor, with several other
kinds of armor in between. The Armor table collects the most commonly
available types of armor found in the game and separates them into three
categories: light armor, medium armor, and heavy armor. Many warriors
supplement their armor with a shield.</p>
<p>The Armor table shows the cost, weight, and other properties of the
common types of armor worn in fantasy gaming worlds.</p>
<p><strong><em>Armor Proficiency</em></strong>. Anyone can put on a suit
of armor or strap a shield to an arm. Only those proficient in the
armor’s use know how to wear it effectively, however. Your class gives
you proficiency with certain types of armor. If you wear armor that you
lack proficiency with, you have disadvantage on any ability check,
saving throw, or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity, and
you can’t cast spells.</p>
<p><strong><em>Armor Class (AC)</em></strong>. Armor protects its wearer
from attacks. The armor (and shield) you wear determines your base Armor
Class.</p>
<p><strong><em>Heavy Armor</em></strong>. Heavier armor interferes with
the wearer’s ability to move quickly, stealthily, and freely. If the
Armor table shows “Str 13” or “Str 15” in the Strength column for an
armor type, the armor reduces the wearer’s speed by 10 feet unless the
wearer has a Strength score equal to or higher than the listed
score.</p>
<p><strong><em>Stealth</em></strong>. If the Armor table shows
“Disadvantage” in the Stealth column, the wearer has disadvantage on
Dexterity (Stealth) checks.</p>
<p><strong><em>Shields</em></strong>. A shield is made from wood or
metal and is carried in one hand. Wielding a shield increases your Armor
Class by 2. You can benefit from only one shield at a time.</p>
<h2 id="light-armor">Light Armor</h2>
<p>Made from supple and thin materials, light armor favors agile
adventurers since it offers some protection without sacrificing
mobility. If you wear light armor, you add your Dexterity modifier to
the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.</p>
<p><strong><em>Padded</em></strong>. Padded armor consists of quilted
layers of cloth and batting.</p>
<p><strong><em>Leather</em></strong>. The breastplate and shoulder
protectors of this armor are made of leather that has been stiffened by
being boiled in oil. The rest of the armor is made of softer and more
flexible materials.</p>
<p><strong><em>Studded Leather</em></strong>. Made from tough but
flexible leather, studded leather is reinforced with close-set rivets or
spikes.</p>
<h2 id="medium-armor">Medium Armor</h2>
<p>Medium armor offers more protection than light armor, but it also
impairs movement more. If you wear medium armor, you add your Dexterity
modifier, to a maximum of +2, to the base number from your armor type to
determine your Armor Class.</p>
<p><strong><em>Hide</em></strong>. This crude armor consists of thick
furs and pelts. It is commonly worn by barbarian tribes, evil humanoids,
and other folk who lack access to the tools and materials needed to
create better armor.</p>
<p><strong><em>Chain Shirt</em></strong>. Made of interlocking metal
rings, a chain shirt is worn between layers of clothing or leather. This
armor offers modest protection to the wearer’s upper body and allows the
sound of the rings rubbing against one another to be muffled by outer
layers.</p>
<p><strong><em>Scale Mail</em></strong>. This armor consists of a coat
and leggings (and perhaps a separate skirt) of leather covered with
overlapping pieces of metal, much like the scales of a fish. The suit
includes gauntlets.</p>
<p><strong><em>Breastplate</em></strong>. This armor consists of a
fitted metal chest piece worn with supple leather. Although it leaves
the legs and arms relatively unprotected, this armor provides good
protection for the wearer’s vital organs while leaving the wearer
relatively unencumbered.</p>
<p><strong><em>Half Plate</em></strong>. Half plate consists of shaped
metal plates that cover most of the wearer’s body. It does not include
leg protection beyond simple greaves that are attached with leather
straps.</p>
<h2 id="heavy-armor">Heavy Armor</h2>
<p>Of all the armor categories, heavy armor offers the best protection.
These suits of armor cover the entire body and are designed to stop a
wide range of attacks. Only proficient warriors can manage their weight
and bulk.</p>
<p>Heavy armor doesn’t let you add your Dexterity modifier to your Armor
Class, but it also doesn’t penalize you if your Dexterity modifier is
negative.</p>
<p><strong><em>Ring Mail</em></strong>. This armor is leather armor with
heavy rings sewn into it. The rings help reinforce the armor against
blows from swords and axes. Ring mail is inferior to chain mail, and
it’s usually worn only by those who can’t afford better armor.</p>
<p><strong><em>Chain Mail</em></strong>. Made of interlocking metal
rings, chain mail includes a layer of quilted fabric worn underneath the
mail to prevent chafing and to cushion the impact of blows. The suit
includes gauntlets.</p>
<p><strong><em>Splint</em></strong>. This armor is made of narrow
vertical strips of metal riveted to a backing of leather that is worn
over cloth padding. Flexible chain mail protects the joints.</p>
<p><strong><em>Plate</em></strong>. Plate consists of shaped,
interlocking metal plates to cover the entire body. A suit of plate
includes gauntlets, heavy leather boots, a visored helmet, and thick
layers of padding underneath the armor. Buckles and straps distribute
the weight over the body.</p>

<h1 id="weapons">Weapons</h1>
<p>Your class grants proficiency in certain weapons, reflecting both the
class’s focus and the tools you are most likely to use. Whether you
favor a longsword or a longbow, your weapon and your ability to wield it
effectively can mean the difference between life and death while
adventuring.</p>
<p>The Weapons table shows the most common weapons used in the fantasy
gaming worlds, their price and weight, the damage they deal when they
hit, and any special properties they possess. Every weapon is classified
as either melee or ranged. A <strong>melee weapon</strong> is used to
attack a target within 5 feet of you, whereas a <strong>ranged
weapon</strong> is used to attack a target at a distance.</p>
<h2 id="weapon-proficiency">Weapon Proficiency</h2>
<p>Your race and class can grant you proficiency with certain weapons or
categories of weapons. The two categories are <strong>simple</strong>
and <strong>martial</strong>. Most people can use simple weapons with
proficiency. These weapons include clubs, maces, and other weapons often
found in the hands of commoners. Martial weapons, including swords,
axes, and polearms, require more specialized training to use
effectively. Most warriors use martial weapons because these weapons put
their fighting style and training to best use.</p>
<p>Proficiency with a weapon allows you to add your proficiency bonus to
the attack roll for any attack you make with that weapon. If you make an
attack roll using a weapon with which you lack proficiency, you do not
add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll.</p>
<h2 id="weapon-properties">Weapon Properties</h2>
<p>Many weapons have special properties related to their use, as shown
in the Weapons table.</p>
<p><strong><em>Ammunition</em></strong>. You can use a weapon that has
the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have
ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the
weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from
a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a
free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you
can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search
the battlefield.</p>
<p>If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee
attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see “Improvised
Weapons” later in the section). A sling must be loaded to deal any
damage when used in this way.</p>
<p><strong><em>Finesse</em></strong>. When making an attack with a
finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity
modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier
for both rolls.</p>
<p><strong><em>Heavy</em></strong>. Small creatures have disadvantage on
attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon’s size and bulk make it
too large for a Small creature to use effectively.</p>
<p><strong><em>Light</em></strong>. A light weapon is small and easy to
handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.</p>
<p><strong><em>Loading</em></strong>. Because of the time required to
load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when
you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of
the number of attacks you can normally make.</p>
<p><strong><em>Range</em></strong>. A weapon that can be used to make a
ranged attack has a range in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown
property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon’s normal
range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon’s long range. When
attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the
attack roll. You can’t attack a target beyond the weapon’s long
range.</p>
<p><strong><em>Reach</em></strong>. This weapon adds 5 feet to your
reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach
for opportunity attacks with it.</p>
<p><strong><em>Special</em></strong>. A weapon with the special property
has unusual rules governing its use, explained in the weapon’s
description (see “Special Weapons” later in this section).</p>
<p><strong><em>Thrown</em></strong>. If a weapon has the thrown
property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the
weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that
attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with
the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength,
but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your
Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.</p>
<p><strong><em>Two-Handed</em></strong>. This weapon requires two hands
when you attack with it.</p>
<p><strong><em>Versatile</em></strong>. This weapon can be used with one
or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the
property-the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a
melee attack.</p>
<h3 id="improvised-weapons">Improvised Weapons</h3>
<p>Sometimes characters don’t have their weapons and have to attack with
whatever is at hand. An improvised weapon includes any object you can
wield in one or two hands, such as broken glass, a table leg, a frying
pan, a wagon wheel, or a dead goblin.</p>
<p>Often, an improvised weapon is similar to an actual weapon and can be
treated as such. For example, a table leg is akin to a club. At the GM’s
option, a character proficient with a weapon can use a similar object as
if it were that weapon and use his or her proficiency bonus.</p>
<p>An object that bears no resemblance to a weapon deals 1d4 damage (the
GM assigns a damage type appropriate to the object). If a character uses
a ranged weapon to make a melee attack, or throws a melee weapon that
does not have the thrown property, it also deals 1d4 damage. An
improvised thrown weapon has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range
of 60 feet.</p>
<h4 id="silvered-weapons">Silvered Weapons</h4>
<p>Some monsters that have immunity or resistance to nonmagical weapons
are susceptible to silver weapons, so cautious adventurers invest extra
coin to plate their weapons with silver. You can silver a single weapon
or ten pieces of ammunition for 100 gp. This cost represents not only
the price of the silver, but the time and expertise needed to add silver
to the weapon without making it less effective.</p>
<h4 id="special-weapons">Special Weapons</h4>
<p>Weapons with special rules are described here.</p>
<p><strong><em>Lance</em></strong>. You have disadvantage when you use a
lance to attack a target within 5 feet of you. Also, a lance requires
two hands to wield when you aren’t mounted.</p>
<p><strong><em>Net</em></strong>. A Large or smaller creature hit by a
net is restrained until it is freed. A net has no effect on creatures
that are formless, or creatures that are Huge or larger. A creature can
use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another
creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the
net (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the
effect and destroying the net.</p>
<p>When you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to attack with a
net, you can make only one attack regardless of the number of attacks
you can normally make.</p>

<h1 id="adventuring-gear">Adventuring Gear</h1>
<p>This section describes items that have special rules or require
further explanation.</p>
<p><strong><em>Acid</em></strong>. As an action, you can splash the
contents of this vial onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw the
vial up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a
ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the acid as an
improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 acid damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Alchemist’s Fire</em></strong>. This sticky, adhesive
fluid ignites when exposed to air. As an action, you can throw this
flask up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack
against a creature or object, treating the alchemist’s fire as an
improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 fire damage at the
start of each of its turns. A creature can end this damage by using its
action to make a DC 10 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames.</p>
<p><strong><em>Antitoxin</em></strong>. A creature that drinks this vial
of liquid gains advantage on saving throws against poison for 1 hour. It
confers no benefit to undead or constructs.</p>
<p><strong><em>Arcane Focus</em></strong>. An arcane focus is a special
item-an orb, a crystal, a rod, a specially constructed staff, a
wand-like length of wood, or some similar item- designed to channel the
power of arcane spells. A sorcerer, warlock, or wizard can use such an
item as a spellcasting focus.</p>
<p><strong><em>Ball Bearings</em></strong>. As an action, you can spill
these tiny metal balls from their pouch to cover a level, square area
that is 10 feet on a side. A creature moving across the covered area
must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. A creature
moving through the area at half speed doesn’t need to make the save.</p>
<p><strong><em>Block and Tackle</em></strong>. A set of pulleys with a
cable threaded through them and a hook to attach to objects, a block and
tackle allows you to hoist up to four times the weight you can normally
lift.</p>
<p><strong><em>Book</em></strong>. A book might contain poetry,
historical accounts, information pertaining to a particular field of
lore, diagrams and notes on gnomish contraptions, or just about anything
else that can be represented using text or pictures. A book of spells is
a spellbook (described later in this section).</p>
<p><strong><em>Caltrops</em></strong>. As an action, you can spread a
bag of caltrops to cover a square area that is 5 feet on a side. Any
creature that enters the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving
throw or stop moving this turn and take 1 piercing damage. Taking this
damage reduces the creature’s walking speed by 10 feet until the
creature regains at least 1 hit point. A creature moving through the
area at half speed doesn’t need to make the save.</p>
<p><strong><em>Candle</em></strong>. For 1 hour, a candle sheds bright
light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.</p>
<p><strong><em>Case, Crossbow Bolt</em></strong>. This wooden case can
hold up to twenty crossbow bolts.</p>
<p><strong><em>Case, Map or Scroll</em></strong>. This cylindrical
leather case can hold up to ten rolled-up sheets of paper or five
rolled-up sheets of parchment.</p>
<p><strong><em>Chain</em></strong>. A chain has 10 hit points. It can be
burst with a successful DC 20 Strength check.</p>
<p><strong><em>Climber’s Kit</em></strong>. A climber’s kit includes
special pitons, boot tips, gloves, and a harness. You can use the
climber’s kit as an action to anchor yourself; when you do, you can’t
fall more than 25 feet from the point where you anchored yourself, and
you can’t climb more than 25 feet away from that point without undoing
the anchor.</p>
<p><strong><em>Component Pouch</em></strong>. A component pouch is a
small, watertight leather belt pouch that has compartments to hold all
the material components and other special items you need to cast your
spells, except for those components that have a specific cost (as
indicated in a spell’s description).</p>
<p><strong><em>Crowbar</em></strong>. Using a crowbar grants advantage
to Strength checks where the crowbar’s leverage can be applied.</p>
<p><strong><em>Druidic Focus</em></strong>. A druidic focus might be a
sprig of mistletoe or holly, a wand or scepter made of yew or another
special wood, a staff drawn whole out of a living tree, or a totem
object incorporating feathers, fur, bones, and teeth from sacred
animals. A druid can use such an object as a spellcasting focus.</p>
<p><strong><em>Fishing Tackle</em></strong>. This kit includes a wooden
rod, silken line, corkwood bobbers, steel hooks, lead sinkers, velvet
lures, and narrow netting. Healer’s Kit. This kit is a leather pouch
containing bandages, salves, and splints. The kit has ten uses. As an
action, you can expend one use of the kit to stabilize a creature that
has 0 hit points, without needing to make a Wisdom (Medicine) check.</p>
<p><strong><em>Holy Symbol</em></strong>. A holy symbol is a
representation of a god or pantheon. It might be an amulet depicting a
symbol representing a deity, the same symbol carefully engraved or
inlaid as an emblem on a shield, or a tiny box holding a fragment of a
sacred relic. Appendix PH-B “Fantasy-Historical Pantheons” lists the
symbols commonly associated with many gods in the multiverse. A cleric
or paladin can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus. To use the
symbol in this way, the caster must hold it in hand, wear it visibly, or
bear it on a shield.</p>
<p><strong><em>Holy Water</em></strong>. As an action, you can splash
the contents of this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw
it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged
attack against a target creature, treating the holy water as an
improvised weapon. If the target is a fiend or undead, it takes 2d6
radiant damage. A cleric or paladin may create holy water by performing
a special ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour to perform, uses 25 gp worth
of powdered silver, and requires the caster to expend a 1st-level spell
slot.</p>
<p><strong><em>Hunting Trap</em></strong>. When you use your action to
set it, this trap forms a saw-toothed steel ring that snaps shut when a
creature steps on a pressure plate in the center. The trap is affixed by
a heavy chain to an immobile object, such as a tree or a spike driven
into the ground. A creature that steps on the plate must succeed on a DC
13 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d4 piercing damage and stop moving.
Thereafter, until the creature breaks free of the trap, its movement is
limited by the length of the chain (typically 3 feet long). A creature
can use its action to make a DC 13 Strength check, freeing itself or
another creature within its reach on a success. Each failed check deals
1 piercing damage to the trapped creature.</p>
<p><strong><em>Lamp</em></strong>. A lamp casts bright light in a
15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Once lit, it
burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil. Lantern, Bullseye. A
bullseye lantern casts bright light in a 60-foot cone and dim light for
an additional 60 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1
pint) of oil. Lantern, Hooded. A hooded lantern casts bright light in a
30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Once lit, it
burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil. As an action, you can
lower the hood, reducing the light to dim light in a 5-foot radius.</p>
<p><strong><em>Lock</em></strong>. A key is provided with the lock.
Without the key, a creature proficient with thieves’ tools can pick this
lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. Your GM may decide that
better locks are available for higher prices.</p>
<p><strong><em>Magnifying Glass</em></strong>. This lens allows a closer
look at small objects. It is also useful as a substitute for flint and
steel when starting fires. Lighting a fire with a magnifying glass
requires light as bright as sunlight to focus, tinder to ignite, and
about 5 minutes for the fire to ignite. A magnifying glass grants
advantage on any ability check made to appraise or inspect an item that
is small or highly detailed.</p>
<p><strong><em>Manacles</em></strong>. These metal restraints can bind a
Small or Medium creature. Escaping the manacles requires a successful DC
20 Dexterity check. Breaking them requires a successful DC 20 Strength
check. Each set of manacles comes with one key. Without the key, a
creature proficient with thieves’ tools can pick the manacles’ lock with
a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. Manacles have 15 hit points.</p>
<p><strong><em>Mess Kit</em></strong>. This tin box contains a cup and
simple cutlery. The box clamps together, and one side can be used as a
cooking pan and the other as a plate or shallow bowl.</p>
<p><strong><em>Oil</em></strong>. Oil usually comes in a clay flask that
holds 1 pint. As an action, you can splash the oil in this flask onto a
creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it
on impact. Make a ranged attack against a target creature or object,
treating the oil as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target is
covered in oil. If the target takes any fire damage before the oil dries
(after 1 minute), the target takes an additional 5 fire damage from the
burning oil. You can also pour a flask of oil on the ground to cover a
5-foot square area, provided that the surface is level. If lit, the oil
burns for 2 rounds and deals 5 fire damage to any creature that enters
the area or ends its turn in the area. A creature can take this damage
only once per turn.</p>
<p><strong><em>Poison, Basic</em></strong>. You can use the poison in
this vial to coat one slashing or piercing weapon or up to three pieces
of ammunition. Applying the poison takes an action. A creature hit by
the poisoned weapon or ammunition must make a DC 10 Constitution saving
throw or take 1d4 poison damage. Once applied, the poison retains
potency for 1 minute before drying.</p>
<p><strong><em>Potion of Healing</em></strong>. A character who drinks
the magical red fluid in this vial regains 2d4 + 2 hit points. Drinking
or administering a potion takes an action.</p>
<p><strong><em>Pouch</em></strong>. A cloth or leather pouch can hold up
to 20 sling bullets or 50 blowgun needles, among other things. A
compartmentalized pouch for holding spell components is called a
component pouch (described earlier in this section). Quiver. A quiver
can hold up to 20 arrows. Ram, Portable. You can use a portable ram to
break down doors. When doing so, you gain a +4 bonus on the Strength
check. One other character can help you use the ram, giving you
advantage on this check.</p>
<p><strong><em>Rations</em></strong>. Rations consist of dry foods
suitable for extended travel, including jerky, dried fruit, hardtack,
and nuts.</p>
<p><strong><em>Rope</em></strong>. Rope, whether made of hemp or silk,
has 2 hit points and can be burst with a DC 17 Strength check.</p>
<p><strong><em>Scale, Merchant’s</em></strong>. A scale includes a small
balance, pans, and a suitable assortment of weights up to 2 pounds. With
it, you can measure the exact weight of small objects, such as raw
precious metals or trade goods, to help determine their worth.</p>
<p><strong><em>Spellbook</em></strong>. Essential for wizards, a
spellbook is a leather-bound tome with 100 blank vellum pages suitable
for recording spells.</p>
<p><strong><em>Spyglass</em></strong>. Objects viewed through a spyglass
are magnified to twice their size.</p>
<p><strong><em>Tent</em></strong>. A simple and portable canvas shelter,
a tent sleeps two.</p>
<p><strong><em>Tinderbox</em></strong>. This small container holds
flint, fire steel, and tinder (usually dry cloth soaked in light oil)
used to kindle a fire. Using it to light a torch-or anything else with
abundant, exposed fuel-takes an action. Lighting any other fire takes 1
minute.</p>
<p><strong><em>Torch</em></strong>. A torch burns for 1 hour, providing
bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20
feet. If you make a melee attack with a burning torch and hit, it deals
1 fire damage.</p>
<p><strong>Equipment Packs</strong></p>
<p>The starting equipment you get from your class includes a collection
of useful adventuring gear, put together in a pack. The contents of

<p>* You can also strap items, such as a bedroll or a coil of rope, to
the outside of a backpack. # Tools</p>
<p>A tool helps you to do something you couldn’t otherwise do, such as
craft or repair an item, forge a document, or pick a lock. Your race,
class, or background give you proficiency with certain tools.
Proficiency with a tool allows you to add your proficiency bonus to any
ability check you make using that tool. Tool use is not tied to a single
ability, since proficiency with a tool represents broader knowledge of
its use. For example, the GM might ask you to make a Dexterity check to
carve a fine detail with your woodcarver’s tools, or a Strength check to
make something out of particularly hard wood.</p>

<p><strong><em>Artisan’s Tools</em></strong>. These special tools
include the items needed to pursue a craft or trade. The table shows
examples of the most common types of tools, each providing items related

bonus to any ability checks you make to create a visual disguise.</p>
<p><strong><em>Forgery Kit</em></strong>. This small box contains a
variety of papers and parchments, pens and inks, seals and sealing wax,
gold and silver leaf, and other supplies necessary to create convincing
forgeries of physical documents. Proficiency with this kit lets you add
your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to create a
physical forgery of a document.</p>
<p><strong><em>Gaming Set</em></strong>. This item encompasses a wide
range of game pieces, including dice and decks of cards (for games such
as Three-Dragon Ante). A few common examples appear on the Tools table,
but other kinds of gaming sets exist. If you are proficient with a
gaming set, you can add your proficiency bonus to ability checks you
make to play a game with that set. Each type of gaming set requires a
separate proficiency.</p>
<p><strong><em>Herbalism Kit</em></strong>. This kit contains a variety
of instruments such as clippers, mortar and pestle, and pouches and
vials used by herbalists to create remedies and potions. Proficiency
with this kit lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks
you make to identify or apply herbs. Also, proficiency with this kit is
required to create antitoxin and potions of healing.</p>
<p><strong><em>Musical Instrument</em></strong>. Several of the most
common types of musical instruments are shown on the table as examples.
If you have proficiency with a given musical instrument, you can add
your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to play music with
the instrument. A bard can use a musical instrument as a spellcasting
focus. Each type of musical instrument requires a separate
proficiency.</p>
<p><strong><em>Navigator’s Tools</em></strong>. This set of instruments
is used for navigation at sea. Proficiency with navigator’s tools lets
you chart a ship’s course and follow navigation charts. In addition,
these tools allow you to add your proficiency bonus to any ability check
you make to avoid getting lost at sea.</p>
<p><strong><em>Poisoner’s Kit</em></strong>. A poisoner’s kit includes
the vials, chemicals, and other equipment necessary for the creation of
poisons. Proficiency with this kit lets you add your proficiency bonus
to any ability checks you make to craft or use poisons.</p>
<p><strong><em>Thieves’ Tools</em></strong>. This set of tools includes
a small file, a set of lock picks, a small mirror mounted on a metal
handle, a set of narrow-bladed scissors, and a pair of pliers.
Proficiency with these tools lets you add your proficiency bonus to any
ability checks you make to disarm traps or open locks. # Mounts and
Vehicles</p>
<p>A good mount can help you move more quickly through the wilderness,
but its primary purpose is to carry the gear that would otherwise slow
you down. The Mounts and Other Animals table shows each animal’s speed
and base carrying capacity.</p>
<p>An animal pulling a carriage, cart, chariot, sled, or wagon can move
weight up to five times its base carrying capacity, including the weight
of the vehicle. If multiple animals pull the same vehicle, they can add
their carrying capacity together.</p>
<p>Mounts other than those listed here are available in fantasy gaming
worlds, but they are rare and not normally available for purchase. These
include flying mounts (pegasi, griffons, hippogriffs, and similar
animals) and even aquatic mounts (giant sea horses, for example).
Acquiring such a mount often means securing an egg and raising the
creature yourself, making a bargain with a powerful entity, or
negotiating with the mount itself.</p>
<p><strong><em>Barding</em></strong>. Barding is armor designed to
protect an animal’s head, neck, chest, and body. Any type of armor shown
on the Armor table can be purchased as barding. The cost is four times
the equivalent armor made for humanoids, and it weighs twice as
much.</p>
<p><strong><em>Saddles</em></strong>. A military saddle braces the
rider, helping you keep your seat on an active mount in battle. It gives
you advantage on any check you make to remain mounted. An exotic saddle
is required for riding any aquatic or flying mount.</p>
<p><strong><em>Vehicle Proficiency</em></strong>. If you have
proficiency with a certain kind of vehicle (land or water), you can add
your proficiency bonus to any check you make to control that kind of
vehicle in difficult circumstances.</p>
<p><strong><em>Rowed Vessels</em></strong>. Keelboats and rowboats are
used on lakes and rivers. If going downstream, add the speed of the
current (typically 3 miles per hour) to the speed of the vehicle. These
vehicles can’t be rowed against any significant current, but they can be
pulled upstream by draft animals on the shores. A rowboat weighs 100
pounds, in case adventurers carry it over land.</p>

<p>Most wealth is not in coins. It is measured in livestock, grain,
land, rights to collect taxes, or rights to resources (such as a mine or

<p>Guilds, nobles, and royalty regulate trade. Chartered companies are
granted rights to conduct trade along certain routes, to send merchant
ships to various ports, or to buy or sell specific goods. Guilds set
prices for the goods or services that they control, and determine who

<h1 id="expenses">Expenses</h1>
<p>When not descending into the depths of the earth, exploring ruins for
lost treasures, or waging war against the encroaching darkness,
adventurers face more mundane realities. Even in a fantastical world,
people require basic necessities such as shelter, sustenance, and
clothing. These things cost money, although some lifestyles cost more
than others.</p>
<h2 id="lifestyle-expenses">Lifestyle Expenses</h2>
<p>Lifestyle expenses provide you with a simple way to account for the
cost of living in a fantasy world. They cover your accommodations, food
and drink, and all your other necessities. Furthermore, expenses cover
the cost of maintaining your equipment so you can be ready when
adventure next calls.</p>
<p>At the start of each week or month (your choice), choose a lifestyle
from the Expenses table and pay the price to sustain that lifestyle. The
prices listed are per day, so if you wish to calculate the cost of your
chosen lifestyle over a thirty-day period, multiply the listed price by
30. Your lifestyle might change from one period to the next, based on
the funds you have at your disposal, or you might maintain the same
lifestyle throughout your character’s career.</p>
<p>Your lifestyle choice can have consequences. Maintaining a wealthy
lifestyle might help you make contacts with the rich and powerful,
though you run the risk of attracting thieves. Likewise, living frugally
might help you avoid criminals, but you are unlikely to make powerful
connections.</p>

<p><strong><em>Wretched</em></strong>. You live in inhumane conditions.
With no place to call home, you shelter wherever you can, sneaking into
barns, huddling in old crates, and relying on the good graces of people
better off than you. A wretched lifestyle presents abundant dangers.
Violence, disease, and hunger follow you wherever you go. Other wretched
people covet your armor, weapons, and adventuring gear, which represent
a fortune by their standards. You are beneath the notice of most
people.</p>
<p><strong><em>Squalid</em></strong>. You live in a leaky stable, a
mud-floored hut just outside town, or a vermin-infested boarding house
in the worst part of town. You have shelter from the elements, but you
live in a desperate and often violent environment, in places rife with
disease, hunger, and misfortune. You are beneath the notice of most
people, and you have few legal protections. Most people at this
lifestyle level have suffered some terrible setback. They might be
disturbed, marked as exiles, or suffer from disease.</p>
<p><strong><em>Poor</em></strong>. A poor lifestyle means going without
the comforts available in a stable community. Simple food and lodgings,
threadbare clothing, and unpredictable conditions result in a
sufficient, though probably unpleasant, experience. Your accommodations
might be a room in a flophouse or in the common room above a tavern. You
benefit from some legal protections, but you still have to contend with
violence, crime, and disease. People at this lifestyle level tend to be
unskilled laborers, costermongers, peddlers, thieves, mercenaries, and
other disreputable types.</p>
<p><strong><em>Modest</em></strong>. A modest lifestyle keeps you out of
the slums and ensures that you can maintain your equipment. You live in
an older part of town, renting a room in a boarding house, inn, or
temple. You don’t go hungry or thirsty, and your living conditions are
clean, if simple. Ordinary people living modest lifestyles include
soldiers with families, laborers, students, priests, hedge wizards, and
the like.</p>
<p><strong><em>Comfortable</em></strong>. Choosing a comfortable
lifestyle means that you can afford nicer clothing and can easily
maintain your equipment. You live in a small cottage in a middle-class
neighborhood or in a private room at a fine inn. You associate with
merchants, skilled tradespeople, and military officers.</p>
<p><strong><em>Wealthy</em></strong>. Choosing a wealthy lifestyle means
living a life of luxury, though you might not have achieved the social
status associated with the old money of nobility or royalty. You live a
lifestyle comparable to that of a highly successful merchant, a favored
servant of the royalty, or the owner of a few small businesses. You have
respectable lodgings, usually a spacious home in a good part of town or
a comfortable suite at a fine inn. You likely have a small staff of
servants.</p>
<p><strong><em>Aristocratic</em></strong>. You live a life of plenty and
comfort. You move in circles populated by the most powerful people in
the community. You have excellent lodgings, perhaps a townhouse in the
nicest part of town or rooms in the finest inn. You dine at the best
restaurants, retain the most skilled and fashionable tailor, and have
servants attending to your every need. You receive invitations to the
social gatherings of the rich and powerful, and spend evenings in the
company of politicians, guild leaders, high priests, and nobility. You
must also contend with the highest levels of deceit and treachery. The
wealthier you are, the greater the chance you will be drawn into
political intrigue as a pawn or participant.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Self-Sufficiency</strong></p>
<p>The expenses and lifestyles described here assume that you are
spending your time between adventures in town, availing yourself of
whatever services you can afford-paying for food and shelter, paying
townspeople to sharpen your sword and repair your armor, and so on. Some
characters, though, might prefer to spend their time away from
civilization, sustaining themselves in the wild by hunting, foraging,
and repairing their own gear.</p>
<p>Maintaining this kind of lifestyle doesn’t require you to spend any
coin, but it is time-consuming. If you spend your time between
adventures practicing a profession, you can eke out the equivalent of a
poor lifestyle. Proficiency in the Survival skill lets you live at the
equivalent of a comfortable lifestyle.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="services">Services</h2>
<p>Adventurers can pay nonplayer characters to assist them or act on
their behalf in a variety of circumstances. Most such hirelings have
fairly ordinary skills, while others are masters of a craft or art, and
a few are experts with specialized adventuring skills.</p>
<p>Some of the most basic types of hirelings appear on the Services
table. Other common hirelings include any of the wide variety of people
who inhabit a typical town or city, when the adventurers pay them to
perform a specific task. For example, a wizard might pay a carpenter to
construct an elaborate chest (and its miniature replica) for use in the
<em>secret chest</em> spell. A fighter might commission a blacksmith to
forge a special sword. A bard might pay a tailor to make exquisite
clothing for an upcoming performance in front of the duke.</p>
<p>Other hirelings provide more expert or dangerous services. Mercenary
soldiers paid to help the adventurers take on a hobgoblin army are
hirelings, as are sages hired to research ancient or esoteric lore. If a
high-level adventurer establishes a stronghold of some kind, he or she
might hire a whole staff of servants and agents to run the place, from a
castellan or steward to menial laborers to keep the stables clean. These
hirelings often enjoy a long-term contract that includes a place to live
within the stronghold as part of the offered compensation.</p>
<p>Skilled hirelings include anyone hired to perform a service that
involves a proficiency (including weapon, tool, or skill): a mercenary,
artisan, scribe, and so on. The pay shown is a minimum; some expert
hirelings require more pay. Untrained hirelings are hired for menial
work that requires no particular skill and can include laborers,
porters, maids, and similar workers.</p>

<h2 id="spellcasting-services">Spellcasting Services</h2>
<p>People who are able to cast spells don’t fall into the category of
ordinary hirelings. It might be possible to find someone willing to cast
a spell in exchange for coin or favors, but it is rarely easy and no
established pay rates exist. As a rule, the higher the level of the
desired spell, the harder it is to find someone who can cast it and the
more it costs.</p>
<p>Hiring someone to cast a relatively common spell of 1st or 2nd level,
such as <em>cure wounds</em> or <em>identify</em>, is easy enough in a
city or town, and might cost 10 to 50 gold pieces (plus the cost of any
expensive material components). Finding someone able and willing to cast
a higher-level spell might involve traveling to a large city, perhaps
one with a university or prominent temple. Once found, the spellcaster
might ask for a service instead of payment-the kind of service that only
adventurers can provide, such as retrieving a rare item from a dangerous
locale or traversing a monster-infested wilderness to deliver something
important to a distant settlement.</p>
<h1 id="abilities">Abilities</h1>
<p>Six abilities provide a quick description of every creature’s
physical and mental characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strength</strong>, measuring physical power</li>
<li><strong>Dexterity</strong>, measuring agility</li>
<li><strong>Constitution</strong>, measuring endurance</li>
<li><strong>Intelligence</strong>, measuring reasoning and memory</li>
<li><strong>Wisdom</strong>, measuring perception and insight</li>
<li><strong>Charisma</strong>, measuring force of personality</li>
</ul>
<p>Is a character muscle-bound and insightful? Brilliant and charming?
Nimble and hardy? Ability scores define these qualities-a creature’s
assets as well as weaknesses.</p>
<p>The three main rolls of the game-the ability check, the saving throw,
and the attack roll-rely on the six ability scores. The book’s
introduction describes the basic rule behind these rolls: roll a d20,
add an ability modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and
compare the total to a target number.</p>
<h2 id="ability-scores-and-modifiers">Ability Scores and Modifiers</h2>
<p>Each of a creature’s abilities has a score, a number that defines the
magnitude of that ability. An ability score is not just a measure of
innate capabilities, but also encompasses a creature’s training and
competence in activities related to that ability.</p>
<p>A score of 10 or 11 is the normal human average, but adventurers and
many monsters are a cut above average in most abilities. A score of 18
is the highest that a person usually reaches. Adventurers can have
scores as high as 20, and monsters and divine beings can have scores as
high as 30.</p>
<p>Each ability also has a modifier, derived from the score and ranging
from -5 (for an ability score of 1) to +10 (for a score of 30). The
Ability Scores and Modifiers table notes the ability modifiers for the
range of possible ability scores, from 1 to 30.</p>

</table>
<p>To determine an ability modifier without consulting the table,
subtract 10 from the ability score and then divide the total by 2 (round
down).</p>
<p>Because ability modifiers affect almost every attack roll, ability
check, and saving throw, ability modifiers come up in play more often
than their associated scores.</p>
<h1 id="advantage-and-disadvantage">Advantage and Disadvantage</h1>
<p>Sometimes a special ability or spell tells you that you have
advantage or disadvantage on an ability check, a saving throw, or an
attack roll. When that happens, you roll a second d20 when you make the
roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the
lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if you have
disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have
advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17.</p>
<p>If multiple situations affect a roll and each one grants advantage or
imposes disadvantage on it, you don’t roll more than one additional d20.
If two favorable situations grant advantage, for example, you still roll
only one additional d20.</p>
<p>If circumstances cause a roll to have both advantage and
disadvantage, you are considered to have neither of them, and you roll
one d20. This is true even if multiple circumstances impose disadvantage
and only one grants advantage or vice versa. In such a situation, you
have neither advantage nor disadvantage.</p>
<p>When you have advantage or disadvantage and something in the game,
such as the halfling’s Lucky trait, lets you reroll or replace the d20,
you can reroll or replace only one of the dice. You choose which one.
For example, if a halfling has advantage or disadvantage on an ability
check and rolls a 1 and a 13, the halfling could use the Lucky trait to
reroll the 1.</p>
<p>You usually gain advantage or disadvantage through the use of special
abilities, actions, or spells. The GM can also decide that circumstances
influence a roll in one direction or the other and grant advantage or
impose disadvantage as a result.</p>
<h1 id="proficiency-bonus">Proficiency Bonus</h1>
<p>Characters have a proficiency bonus determined by level. Monsters
also have this bonus, which is incorporated in their stat blocks. The
bonus is used in the rules on ability checks, saving throws, and attack
rolls.</p>
<p>Your proficiency bonus can’t be added to a single die roll or other
number more than once. For example, if two different rules say you can
add your proficiency bonus to a Wisdom saving throw, you nevertheless
add the bonus only once when you make the save.</p>
<p>Occasionally, your proficiency bonus might be multiplied or divided
(doubled or halved, for example) before you apply it. For example, the
rogue’s Expertise feature doubles the proficiency bonus for certain
ability checks. If a circumstance suggests that your proficiency bonus
applies more than once to the same roll, you still add it only once and
multiply or divide it only once.</p>
<p>By the same token, if a feature or effect allows you to multiply your
proficiency bonus when making an ability check that wouldn’t normally
benefit from your proficiency bonus, you still don’t add the bonus to
the check. For that check your proficiency bonus is 0, given the fact
that multiplying 0 by any number is still 0. For instance, if you lack
proficiency in the History skill, you gain no benefit from a feature
that lets you double your proficiency bonus when you make Intelligence
(History) checks.</p>
<p>In general, you don’t multiply your proficiency bonus for attack
rolls or saving throws. If a feature or effect allows you to do so,
these same rules apply.</p>
<h1 id="ability-checks">Ability Checks</h1>
<p>An ability check tests a character’s or monster’s innate talent and
training in an effort to overcome a challenge. The GM calls for an
ability check when a character or monster attempts an action (other than
an attack) that has a chance of failure. When the outcome is uncertain,
the dice determine the results.</p>
<p>For every ability check, the GM decides which of the six abilities is
relevant to the task at hand and the difficulty of the task, represented
by a Difficulty Class.</p>
<p>The more difficult a task, the higher its DC. The Typical Difficulty
Classes table shows the most common DCs.</p>

</table>
<p>To make an ability check, roll a d20 and add the relevant ability
modifier. As with other d20 rolls, apply bonuses and penalties, and
compare the total to the DC. If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the
ability check is a success-the creature overcomes the challenge at hand.
Otherwise, it’s a failure, which means the character or monster makes no
progress toward the objective or makes progress combined with a setback
determined by the GM.</p>
<h2 id="contests">Contests</h2>
<p>Sometimes one character’s or monster’s efforts are directly opposed
to another’s. This can occur when both of them are trying to do the same
thing and only one can succeed, such as attempting to snatch up a magic
ring that has fallen on the floor. This situation also applies when one
of them is trying to prevent the other one from accomplishing a goal-
for example, when a monster tries to force open a door that an
adventurer is holding closed. In situations like these, the outcome is
determined by a special form of ability check, called a contest.</p>
<p>Both participants in a contest make ability checks appropriate to
their efforts. They apply all appropriate bonuses and penalties, but
instead of comparing the total to a DC, they compare the totals of their
two checks. The participant with the higher check total wins the
contest. That character or monster either succeeds at the action or
prevents the other one from succeeding.</p>
<p>If the contest results in a tie, the situation remains the same as it
was before the contest. Thus, one contestant might win the contest by
default. If two characters tie in a contest to snatch a ring off the
floor, neither character grabs it. In a contest between a monster trying
to open a door and an adventurer trying to keep the door closed, a tie
means that the door remains shut.</p>
<h2 id="skills">Skills</h2>
<p>Each ability covers a broad range of capabilities, including skills
that a character or a monster can be proficient in. A skill represents a
specific aspect of an ability score, and an individual’s proficiency in
a skill demonstrates a focus on that aspect. (A character’s starting
skill proficiencies are determined at character creation, and a
monster’s skill proficiencies appear in the monster’s stat block.)</p>
<p>For example, a Dexterity check might reflect a character’s attempt to
pull off an acrobatic stunt, to palm an object, or to stay hidden. Each
of these aspects of Dexterity has an associated skill: Acrobatics,
Sleight of Hand, and Stealth, respectively. So a character who has
proficiency in the Stealth skill is particularly good at Dexterity
checks related to sneaking and hiding.</p>
<p>The skills related to each ability score are shown in the following
list. (No skills are related to Constitution.) See an ability’s
description in the later sections of this section for examples of how to
use a skill associated with an ability.</p>

<p>Sometimes, the GM might ask for an ability check using a specific
skill-for example, “Make a Wisdom (Perception) check.” At other times, a
player might ask the GM if proficiency in a particular skill applies to
a check. In either case, proficiency in a skill means an individual can
add his or her proficiency bonus to ability checks that involve that
skill. Without proficiency in the skill, the individual makes a normal
ability check.</p>
<p>For example, if a character attempts to climb up a dangerous cliff,
the GM might ask for a Strength (Athletics) check. If the character is
proficient in Athletics, the character’s proficiency bonus is added to
the Strength check. If the character lacks that proficiency, he or she
just makes a Strength check.</p>
<h2 id="passive-checks">Passive Checks</h2>
<p>A passive check is a special kind of ability check that doesn’t
involve any die rolls. Such a check can represent the average result for
a task done repeatedly, such as searching for secret doors over and over
again, or can be used when the GM wants to secretly determine whether
the characters succeed at something without rolling dice, such as
noticing a hidden monster.</p>
<p>Here’s how to determine a character’s total for a passive check:</p>
<p>10 + all modifiers that normally apply to the check</p>
<p>If the character has advantage on the check, add 5. For disadvantage,
subtract 5. The game refers to a passive check total as a
<strong>score</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, if a 1st-level character has a Wisdom of 15 and
proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception)
score of 14.</p>
<p>The rules on hiding in the “Dexterity” section below rely on passive
checks, as do the exploration rules.</p>
<h2 id="working-together">Working Together</h2>
<p>Sometimes two or more characters team up to attempt a task. The
character who’s leading the effort-or the one with the highest ability
modifier-can make an ability check with advantage, reflecting the help
provided by the other characters. In combat, this requires the Help
action.</p>
<p>A character can only provide help if the task is one that he or she
could attempt alone. For example, trying to open a lock requires
proficiency with thieves’ tools, so a character who lacks that
proficiency can’t help another character in that task. Moreover, a
character can help only when two or more individuals working together
would actually be productive. Some tasks, such as threading a needle,
are no easier with help.</p>
<h3 id="group-checks">Group Checks</h3>
<p>When a number of individuals are trying to accomplish something as a
group, the GM might ask for a group ability check. In such a situation,
the characters who are skilled at a particular task help cover those who
aren’t.</p>
<p>To make a group ability check, everyone in the group makes the
ability check. If at least half the group succeeds, the whole group
succeeds. Otherwise, the group fails.</p>
<p>Group checks don’t come up very often, and they’re most useful when
all the characters succeed or fail as a group. For example, when
adventurers are navigating a swamp, the GM might call for a group Wisdom
(Survival) check to see if the characters can avoid the quicksand,
sinkholes, and other natural hazards of the environment. If at least
half the group succeeds, the successful characters are able to guide
their companions out of danger. Otherwise, the group stumbles into one
of these hazards.</p>
<h2 id="using-each-ability">Using Each Ability</h2>
<p>Every task that a character or monster might attempt in the game is
covered by one of the six abilities. This section explains in more
detail what those abilities mean and the ways they are used in the
game.</p>
<h3 id="strength">Strength</h3>
<p>Strength measures bodily power, athletic training, and the extent to
which you can exert raw physical force.</p>
<h4 id="strength-checks">Strength Checks</h4>
<p>A Strength check can model any attempt to lift, push, pull, or break
something, to force your body through a space, or to otherwise apply
brute force to a situation. The Athletics skill reflects aptitude in
certain kinds of Strength checks.</p>
<p><strong><em>Athletics</em></strong>. Your Strength (Athletics) check
covers difficult situations you encounter while climbing, jumping, or
swimming. Examples include the following activities:</p>
<ul>
<li>You attempt to climb a sheer or slippery cliff, avoid hazards while
scaling a wall, or cling to a surface while something is trying to knock
you off.</li>
<li>You try to jump an unusually long distance or pull off a stunt
midjump.</li>
<li>You struggle to swim or stay afloat in treacherous currents,
storm-tossed waves, or areas of thick seaweed. Or another creature tries
to push or pull you underwater or otherwise interfere with your
swimming.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Other Strength Checks</em></strong>. The GM might also
call for a Strength check when you try to accomplish tasks like the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Force open a stuck, locked, or barred door</li>
<li>Break free of bonds</li>
<li>Push through a tunnel that is too small</li>
<li>Hang on to a wagon while being dragged behind it</li>
<li>Tip over a statue</li>
<li>Keep a boulder from rolling</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="attack-rolls-and-damage">Attack Rolls and Damage</h4>
<p>You add your Strength modifier to your attack roll and your damage
roll when attacking with a melee weapon such as a mace, a battleaxe, or
a javelin. You use melee weapons to make melee attacks in hand-to-hand
combat, and some of them can be thrown to make a ranged attack.</p>
<h4 id="lifting-and-carrying">Lifting and Carrying</h4>
<p>Your Strength score determines the amount of weight you can bear. The
following terms define what you can lift or carry.</p>
<p><strong><em>Carrying Capacity</em></strong>. Your carrying capacity
is your Strength score multiplied by 15. This is the weight (in pounds)
that you can carry, which is high enough that most characters don’t
usually have to worry about it.</p>
<p><strong><em>Push, Drag, or Lift</em></strong>. You can push, drag, or
lift a weight in pounds up to twice your carrying capacity (or 30 times
your Strength score). While pushing or dragging weight in excess of your
carrying capacity, your speed drops to 5 feet.</p>
<p><strong><em>Size and Strength</em></strong>. Larger creatures can
bear more weight, whereas Tiny creatures can carry less. For each size
category above Medium, double the creature’s carrying capacity and the
amount it can push, drag, or lift. For a Tiny creature, halve these
weights.</p>
<h3 id="dexterity">Dexterity</h3>
<p>Dexterity measures agility, reflexes, and balance.</p>
<h4 id="dexterity-checks">Dexterity Checks</h4>
<p>A Dexterity check can model any attempt to move nimbly, quickly, or
quietly, or to keep from falling on tricky footing. The Acrobatics,
Sleight of Hand, and Stealth skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of
Dexterity checks.</p>
<p><strong><em>Acrobatics</em></strong>. Your Dexterity (Acrobatics)
check covers your attempt to stay on your feet in a tricky situation,
such as when you’re trying to run across a sheet of ice, balance on a
tightrope, or stay upright on a rocking ship’s deck. The GM might also
call for a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to see if you can perform
acrobatic stunts, including dives, rolls, somersaults, and flips.</p>
<p><strong><em>Sleight of Hand</em></strong>. Whenever you attempt an
act of legerdemain or manual trickery, such as planting something on
someone else or concealing an object on your person, make a Dexterity
(Sleight of Hand) check. The GM might also call for a Dexterity (Sleight
of Hand) check to determine whether you can lift a coin purse off
another person or slip something out of another person’s pocket.</p>
<p><strong><em>Stealth</em></strong>. Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check
when you attempt to conceal yourself from enemies, slink past guards,
slip away without being noticed, or sneak up on someone without being
seen or heard.</p>
<p><strong><em>Other Dexterity Checks</em></strong>. The GM might call
for a Dexterity check when you try to accomplish tasks like the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Control a heavily laden cart on a steep descent</li>
<li>Steer a chariot around a tight turn</li>
<li>Pick a lock</li>
<li>Disable a trap</li>
<li>Securely tie up a prisoner</li>
<li>Wriggle free of bonds</li>
<li>Play a stringed instrument</li>
<li>Craft a small or detailed object</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="attack-rolls-and-damage-1">Attack Rolls and Damage</h4>
<p>You add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage
roll when attacking with a ranged weapon, such as a sling or a longbow.
You can also add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your
damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon that has the finesse
property, such as a dagger or a rapier.</p>
<h4 id="armor-class">Armor Class</h4>
<p>Depending on the armor you wear, you might add some or all of your
Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class.</p>
<h4 id="initiative">Initiative</h4>
<p>At the beginning of every combat, you roll initiative by making a
Dexterity check. Initiative determines the order of creatures’ turns in
combat.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Hiding</strong></p>
<p>The DM decides when circumstances are appropriate for hiding. When
you try to hide, make a Dexterity (Stealth) check. Until you are
discovered or you stop hiding, that check’s total is contested by the
Wisdom (Perception) check of any creature that actively searches for
signs of your presence.</p>
<p>You can’t hide from a creature that can see you clearly, and you give
away your position if you make noise, such as shouting a warning or
knocking over a vase.</p>
<p>An invisible creature can always try to hide. Signs of its passage
might still be noticed, and it does have to stay quiet.</p>
<p>In combat, most creatures stay alert for signs of danger all around,
so if you come out of hiding and approach a creature, it usually sees
you. However, under certain circumstances, the DM might allow you to
stay hidden as you approach a creature that is distracted, allowing you
to gain advantage on an attack roll before you are seen.</p>
<p><strong><em>Passive Perception</em></strong>. When you hide, there’s
a chance someone will notice you even if they aren’t searching. To
determine whether such a creature notices you, the DM compares your
Dexterity (Stealth) check with that creature’s passive Wisdom
(Perception) score, which equals 10 + the creature’s Wisdom modifier, as
well as any other bonuses or penalties. If the creature has advantage,
add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. For example, if a 1st-level
character (with a proficiency bonus of +2) has a Wisdom of 15 (a +2
modifier) and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom
(Perception) of 14.</p>
<p><strong><em>What Can You See?</em></strong> One of the main factors
in determining whether you can find a hidden creature or object is how
well you can see in an area, which might be <strong>lightly</strong> or
<strong>heavily obscured</strong>, as explained in the “Adventuring”
section.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="constitution">Constitution</h3>
<p>Constitution measures health, stamina, and vital force.</p>
<h4 id="constitution-checks">Constitution Checks</h4>
<p>Constitution checks are uncommon, and no skills apply to Constitution
checks, because the endurance this ability represents is largely passive
rather than involving a specific effort on the part of a character or
monster. A Constitution check can model your attempt to push beyond
normal limits, however.</p>
<p>The GM might call for a Constitution check when you try to accomplish
tasks like the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hold your breath</li>
<li>March or labor for hours without rest</li>
<li>Go without sleep</li>
<li>Survive without food or water</li>
<li>Quaff an entire stein of ale in one go</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="hit-points-3">Hit Points</h4>
<p>Your Constitution modifier contributes to your hit points. Typically,
you add your Constitution modifier to each Hit Die you roll for your hit
points.</p>
<p>If your Constitution modifier changes, your hit point maximum changes
as well, as though you had the new modifier from 1st level. For example,
if you raise your Constitution score when you reach 4th level and your
Constitution modifier increases from +1 to +2, you adjust your hit point
maximum as though the modifier had always been +2. So you add 3 hit
points for your first three levels, and then roll your hit points for
4th level using your new modifier. Or if you’re 7th level and some
effect lowers your Constitution score so as to reduce your Constitution
modifier by 1, your hit point maximum is reduced by 7.</p>
<h3 id="intelligence">Intelligence</h3>
<p>Intelligence measures mental acuity, accuracy of recall, and the
ability to reason.</p>
<h4 id="intelligence-checks">Intelligence Checks</h4>
<p>An Intelligence check comes into play when you need to draw on logic,
education, memory, or deductive reasoning. The Arcana, History,
Investigation, Nature, and Religion skills reflect aptitude in certain
kinds of Intelligence checks.</p>
<p><strong><em>Arcana</em></strong>. Your Intelligence (Arcana) check
measures your ability to recall lore about spells, magic items, symbols,
sigils, runes, creatures and magical traditions.</p>
<p><strong><em>History</em></strong>. Your Intelligence (History) check
measures your ability to recall lore about historical events, legendary
people, ancient kingdoms, past disputes, recent wars, and lost
civilizations.</p>
<p><strong><em>Investigation</em></strong>. When you look around for
clues and make deductions based on those clues, you make an Intelligence
(Investigation) check. You might deduce the location of a hidden object,
discern from the appearance of a wound what kind of weapon dealt it, or
determine the weakest point in a tunnel that could cause it to collapse.
Poring through ancient scrolls in search of a hidden fragment of
knowledge might also call for an Intelligence (Investigation) check.</p>
<p><strong><em>Nature</em></strong>. Your Intelligence (Nature) check
measures your ability to recall lore about terrain, plants and animals,
the weather, and natural cycles.</p>
<p><strong><em>Religion</em></strong>. Your Intelligence (Religion)
check measures your ability to recall lore about deities, rites and
prayers, religious hierarchies, holy symbols, and the practices of
secret cults.</p>
<p><strong><em>Other Intelligence Checks</em></strong>. The GM might
call for an Intelligence check when you try to accomplish tasks like the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Communicate with a creature without using words</li>
<li>Estimate the value of a precious item</li>
<li>Pull together a disguise to pass as a city guard</li>
<li>Forge a document</li>
<li>Recall lore about a craft or trade</li>
<li>Win a game of skill</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="spellcasting-ability-2">Spellcasting Ability</h4>
<p>Wizards use Intelligence as their spellcasting ability, which helps
determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.</p>
<h3 id="wisdom">Wisdom</h3>
<p>Wisdom reflects how attuned you are to the world around you and
represents perceptiveness and intuition.</p>
<h4 id="wisdom-checks">Wisdom Checks</h4>
<p>A Wisdom check might reflect an effort to read body language,
understand someone’s feelings, notice things about the environment, or
care for an injured person. The Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine,
Perception, and Survival skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of
Wisdom checks.</p>
<p><strong><em>Animal Handling</em></strong>. When there is any question
whether you can calm down a domesticated animal, keep a mount from
getting spooked, or intuit an animal’s intentions, the GM might call for
a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. You also make a Wisdom (Animal
Handling) check to control your mount when you attempt a risky
maneuver.</p>
<p><strong><em>Insight</em></strong>. Your Wisdom (Insight) check
decides whether you can determine the true intentions of a creature,
such as when searching out a lie or predicting someone’s next move.
Doing so involves gleaning clues from body language, speech habits, and
changes in mannerisms.</p>
<p><strong><em>Medicine</em></strong>. A Wisdom (Medicine) check lets
you try to stabilize a dying companion or diagnose an illness.</p>
<p><strong><em>Perception</em></strong>. Your Wisdom (Perception) check
lets you spot, hear, or otherwise detect the presence of something. It
measures your general awareness of your surroundings and the keenness of
your senses. For example, you might try to hear a conversation through a
closed door, eavesdrop under an open window, or hear monsters moving
stealthily in the forest. Or you might try to spot things that are
obscured or easy to miss, whether they are orcs lying in ambush on a
road, thugs hiding in the shadows of an alley, or candlelight under a
closed secret door.</p>
<p><strong><em>Survival</em></strong>. The GM might ask you to make a
Wisdom (Survival) check to follow tracks, hunt wild game, guide your
group through frozen wastelands, identify signs that owlbears live
nearby, predict the weather, or avoid quicksand and other natural
hazards.</p>
<p><strong><em>Other Wisdom Checks</em></strong>. The GM might call for
a Wisdom check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get a gut feeling about what course of action to follow</li>
<li>Discern whether a seemingly dead or living creature is undead</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="spellcasting-ability-3">Spellcasting Ability</h4>
<p>Clerics, druids, and rangers use Wisdom as their spellcasting
ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they
cast.</p>
<h3 id="charisma">Charisma</h3>
<p>Charisma measures your ability to interact effectively with others.
It includes such factors as confidence and eloquence, and it can
represent a charming or commanding personality.</p>
<h4 id="charisma-checks">Charisma Checks</h4>
<p>A Charisma check might arise when you try to influence or entertain
others, when you try to make an impression or tell a convincing lie, or
when you are navigating a tricky social situation. The Deception,
Intimidation, Performance, and Persuasion skills reflect aptitude in
certain kinds of Charisma checks.</p>
<p><strong><em>Deception</em></strong>. Your Charisma (Deception) check
determines whether you can convincingly hide the truth, either verbally
or through your actions. This deception can encompass everything from
misleading others through ambiguity to telling outright lies. Typical
situations include trying to fast-talk a guard, con a merchant, earn
money through gambling, pass yourself off in a disguise, dull someone’s
suspicions with false assurances, or maintain a straight face while
telling a blatant lie.</p>
<p><strong><em>Intimidation</em></strong>. When you attempt to influence
someone through overt threats, hostile actions, and physical violence,
the GM might ask you to make a Charisma (Intimidation) check. Examples
include trying to pry information out of a prisoner, convincing street
thugs to back down from a confrontation, or using the edge of a broken
bottle to convince a sneering vizier to reconsider a decision.</p>
<p><strong><em>Performance</em></strong>. Your Charisma (Performance)
check determines how well you can delight an audience with music, dance,
acting, storytelling, or some other form of entertainment.</p>
<p><strong><em>Persuasion</em></strong>. When you attempt to influence
someone or a group of people with tact, social graces, or good nature,
the GM might ask you to make a Charisma (Persuasion) check. Typically,
you use persuasion when acting in good faith, to foster friendships,
make cordial requests, or exhibit proper etiquette. Examples of
persuading others include convincing a chamberlain to let your party see
the king, negotiating peace between warring tribes, or inspiring a crowd
of townsfolk.</p>
<p><strong><em>Other Charisma Checks</em></strong>. The GM might call
for a Charisma check when you try to accomplish tasks like the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find the best person to talk to for news, rumors, and gossip</li>
<li>Blend into a crowd to get the sense of key topics of
conversation</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="spellcasting-ability-4">Spellcasting Ability</h4>
<p>Bards, paladins, sorcerers, and warlocks use Charisma as their
spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of
spells they cast.</p>
<h1 id="saving-throws">Saving Throws</h1>
<p>A saving throw-also called a save-represents an attempt to resist a
spell, a trap, a poison, a disease, or a similar threat. You don’t
normally decide to make a saving throw; you are forced to make one
because your character or monster is at risk of harm.</p>
<p>To make a saving throw, roll a d20 and add the appropriate ability
modifier. For example, you use your Dexterity modifier for a Dexterity
saving throw.</p>
<p>A saving throw can be modified by a situational bonus or penalty and
can be affected by advantage and disadvantage, as determined by the
GM.</p>
<p>Each class gives proficiency in at least two saving throws. The
wizard, for example, is proficient in Intelligence saves. As with skill
proficiencies, proficiency in a saving throw lets a character add his or
her proficiency bonus to saving throws made using a particular ability
score. Some monsters have saving throw proficiencies as well.</p>
<p>The Difficulty Class for a saving throw is determined by the effect
that causes it. For example, the DC for a saving throw allowed by a
spell is determined by the caster’s spellcasting ability and proficiency
bonus.</p>
<p>The result of a successful or failed saving throw is also detailed in
the effect that allows the save. Usually, a successful save means that a
creature suffers no harm, or reduced harm, from an effect. #
ADVENTURING</p>
<h1 id="time">Time</h1>
<p>In situations where keeping track of the passage of time is
important, the GM determines the time a task requires. The GM might use
a different time scale depending on the context of the situation at
hand. In a dungeon environment, the adventurers’ movement happens on a
scale of <strong>minutes</strong>. It takes them about a minute to creep
down a long hallway, another minute to check for traps on the door at
the end of the hall, and a good ten minutes to search the chamber beyond
for anything interesting or valuable.</p>
<p>In a city or wilderness, a scale of <strong>hours</strong> is often
more appropriate. Adventurers eager to reach the lonely tower at the
heart of the forest hurry across those fifteen miles in just under four
hours’ time.</p>
<p>For long journeys, a scale of <strong>days</strong> works best.</p>
<p>Following the road from Baldur’s Gate to Waterdeep, the adventurers
spend four uneventful days before a goblin ambush interrupts their
journey.</p>
<p>In combat and other fast-paced situations, the game relies on
<strong>rounds</strong>, a 6-second span of time.</p>
<h1 id="movement">Movement</h1>
<p>Swimming across a rushing river, sneaking down a dungeon corridor,
scaling a treacherous mountain slope-all sorts of movement play a key
role in fantasy gaming adventures.</p>
<p>The GM can summarize the adventurers’ movement without calculating
exact distances or travel times: “You travel through the forest and find
the dungeon entrance late in the evening of the third day.” Even in a
dungeon, particularly a large dungeon or a cave network, the GM can
summarize movement between encounters: “After killing the guardian at
the entrance to the ancient dwarven stronghold, you consult your map,
which leads you through miles of echoing corridors to a chasm bridged by
a narrow stone arch.”</p>
<p>Sometimes it’s important, though, to know how long it takes to get
from one spot to another, whether the answer is in days, hours, or
minutes. The rules for determining travel time depend on two factors:
the speed and travel pace of the creatures moving and the terrain
they’re moving over.</p>
<h2 id="speed">Speed</h2>
<p>Every character and monster has a speed, which is the distance in
feet that the character or monster can walk in 1 round. This number
assumes short bursts of energetic movement in the midst of a
life-threatening situation.</p>
<p>The following rules determine how far a character or monster can move
in a minute, an hour, or a day.</p>
<h3 id="travel-pace">Travel Pace</h3>
<p>While traveling, a group of adventurers can move at a normal, fast,
or slow pace, as shown on the Travel Pace table. The table states how
far the party can move in a period of time and whether the pace has any
effect. A fast pace makes characters less perceptive, while a slow pace
makes it possible to sneak around and to search an area more
carefully.</p>
<p><strong><em>Forced March</em></strong>. The Travel Pace table assumes
that characters travel for 8 hours in day. They can push on beyond that
limit, at the risk of exhaustion.</p>
<p>For each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours, the characters
cover the distance shown in the Hour column for their pace, and each
character must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of the hour.
The DC is 10 + 1 for each hour past 8 hours. On a failed saving throw, a
character suffers one level of exhaustion (see appendix ##).</p>
<p><strong><em>Mounts and Vehicles</em></strong>. For short spans of
time (up to an hour), many animals move much faster than humanoids. A
mounted character can ride at a gallop for about an hour, covering twice
the usual distance for a fast pace. If fresh mounts are available every
8 to 10 miles, characters can cover larger distances at this pace, but
this is very rare except in densely populated areas.</p>
<p>Characters in wagons, carriages, or other land vehicles choose a pace
as normal. Characters in a waterborne vessel are limited to the speed of
the vessel, and they don’t suffer penalties for a fast pace or gain
benefits from a slow pace. Depending on the vessel and the size of the
crew, ships might be able to travel for up to 24 hours per day.</p>
<p>Certain special mounts, such as a pegasus or griffon, or special
vehicles, such as a <em>carpet of flying</em>, allow you to travel more
swiftly.</p>

<h3 id="difficult-terrain">Difficult Terrain</h3>
<p>The travel speeds given in the Travel Pace table assume relatively
simple terrain: roads, open plains, or clear dungeon corridors. But
adventurers often face dense forests, deep swamps, rubble-filled ruins,
steep mountains, and ice-covered ground-all considered difficult
terrain.</p>
<p>You move at half speed in difficult terrain- moving 1 foot in
difficult terrain costs 2 feet of speed-so you can cover only half the
normal distance in a minute, an hour, or a day.</p>
<h2 id="special-types-of-movement">Special Types of Movement</h2>
<p>Movement through dangerous dungeons or wilderness areas often
involves more than simply walking. Adventurers might have to climb,
crawl, swim, or jump to get where they need to go.</p>
<h3 id="climbing-swimming-and-crawling">Climbing, Swimming, and
Crawling</h3>
<p>While climbing or swimming, each foot of movement costs 1 extra foot
(2 extra feet in difficult terrain), unless a creature has a climbing or
swimming speed. At the GM’s option, climbing a slippery vertical surface
or one with few handholds requires a successful Strength (Athletics)
check. Similarly, gaining any distance in rough water might require a
successful Strength (Athletics) check.</p>
<h3 id="jumping">Jumping</h3>
<p>Your Strength determines how far you can jump.</p>
<p><strong><em>Long Jump</em></strong>. When you make a long jump, you
cover a number of feet up to your Strength score if you move at least 10
feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing long
jump, you can leap only half that distance. Either way, each foot you
clear on the jump costs a foot of movement.</p>
<p>This rule assumes that the height of your jump doesn’t matter, such
as a jump across a stream or chasm. At your GM’s option, you must
succeed on a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check to clear a low obstacle
(no taller than a quarter of the jump’s distance), such as a hedge or
low wall. Otherwise, you hit it.</p>
<p>When you land in difficult terrain, you must succeed on a DC 10
Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to land on your feet. Otherwise, you land
prone.</p>
<p><strong><em>High Jump</em></strong>. When you make a high jump, you
leap into the air a number of feet equal to 3 + your Strength modifier
if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When
you make a standing high jump, you can jump only half that distance.
Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement. In
some circumstances, your GM might allow you to make a Strength
(Athletics) check to jump higher than you normally can.</p>
<p>You can extend your arms half your height above yourself during the
jump. Thus, you can reach above you a distance equal to the height of
the jump plus 1½ times your height.</p>
<h1 id="the-environment">The Environment</h1>
<p>By its nature, adventuring involves delving into places that are
dark, dangerous, and full of mysteries to be explored. The rules in this
section cover some of the most important ways in which adventurers
interact with the environment in such places.</p>
<h2 id="falling">Falling</h2>
<p>A fall from a great height is one of the most common hazards facing
an adventurer. At the end of a fall, a creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning
damage for every 10 feet it fell, to a maximum of 20d6. The creature
lands prone, unless it avoids taking damage from the fall.</p>
<h2 id="suffocating">Suffocating</h2>
<p>A creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 +
its Constitution modifier (minimum of 30 seconds).</p>
<p>When a creature runs out of breath or is choking, it can survive for
a number of rounds equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum of 1
round). At the start of its next turn, it drops to 0 hit points and is
dying, and it can’t regain hit points or be stabilized until it can
breathe again.</p>
<p>For example, a creature with a Constitution of 14 can hold its breath
for 3 minutes. If it starts suffocating, it has 2 rounds to reach air
before it drops to 0 hit points.</p>
<h2 id="vision-and-light">Vision and Light</h2>
<p>The most fundamental tasks of adventuring- noticing danger, finding
hidden objects, hitting an enemy in combat, and targeting a spell, to
name just a few-rely heavily on a character’s ability to see. Darkness
and other effects that obscure vision can prove a significant
hindrance.</p>
<p>A given area might be lightly or heavily obscured. In a
<strong>lightly obscured</strong> area, such as dim light, patchy fog,
or moderate foliage, creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception)
checks that rely on sight.</p>
<p>A <strong>heavily obscured</strong> area-such as darkness, opaque
fog, or dense foliage-blocks vision entirely. A creature effectively
suffers from the blinded condition (see appendix ##) when trying to see
something in that area.</p>
<p>The presence or absence of light in an environment creates three
categories of illumination: bright light, dim light, and darkness.</p>
<p><strong>Bright light</strong> lets most creatures see normally.</p>
<p>Even gloomy days provide bright light, as do torches, lanterns,
fires, and other sources of illumination within a specific radius.</p>
<p><strong>Dim light</strong>, also called shadows, creates a lightly
obscured area. An area of dim light is usually a boundary between a
source of bright light, such as a torch, and surrounding darkness. The
soft light of twilight and dawn also counts as dim light. A particularly
brilliant full moon might bathe the land in dim light.</p>
<p><strong>Darkness</strong> creates a heavily obscured area.</p>
<p>Characters face darkness outdoors at night (even most moonlit
nights), within the confines of an unlit dungeon or a subterranean
vault, or in an area of magical darkness.</p>
<h3 id="blindsight">Blindsight</h3>
<p>A creature with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without
relying on sight, within a specific radius. Creatures without eyes, such
as oozes, and creatures with echolocation or heightened senses, such as
bats and true dragons, have this sense.</p>
<h3 id="darkvision">Darkvision</h3>
<p>Many creatures in fantasy gaming worlds, especially those that dwell
underground, have darkvision. Within a specified range, a creature with
darkvision can see in darkness as if the darkness were dim light, so
areas of darkness are only lightly obscured as far as that creature is
concerned. However, the creature can’t discern color in darkness, only
shades of gray.</p>
<h3 id="truesight">Truesight</h3>
<p>A creature with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normal
and magical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically
detect visual illusions and succeed on saving throws against them, and
perceives the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is
transformed by magic.</p>
<h2 id="food-and-water">Food and Water</h2>
<p>Characters who don’t eat or drink suffer the effects of exhaustion
(see appendix ##). Exhaustion caused by lack of food or water can’t be
removed until the character eats and drinks the full required
amount.</p>
<h3 id="food">Food</h3>
<p>A character needs one pound of food per day and can make food last
longer by subsisting on half rations. Eating half a pound of food in a
day counts as half a day without food.</p>
<p>A character can go without food for a number of days equal to 3 + his
or her Constitution modifier (minimum 1). At the end of each day beyond
that limit, a character automatically suffers one level of
exhaustion.</p>
<p>A normal day of eating resets the count of days without food to
zero.</p>
<h3 id="water">Water</h3>
<p>A character needs one gallon of water per day, or two gallons per day
if the weather is hot. A character who drinks only half that much water
must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of
exhaustion at the end of the day. A character with access to even less
water automatically suffers one level of exhaustion at the end of the
day.</p>
<p>If the character already has one or more levels of exhaustion, the
character takes two levels in either case.</p>
<h2 id="interacting-with-objects">Interacting with Objects</h2>
<p>A character’s interaction with objects in an environment is often
simple to resolve in the game. The player tells the GM that his or her
character is doing something, such as moving a lever, and the GM
describes what, if anything, happens.</p>
<p>For example, a character might decide to pull a lever, which might,
in turn, raise a portcullis, cause a room to flood with water, or open a
secret door in a nearby wall. If the lever is rusted in position,
though, a character might need to force it. In such a situation, the GM
might call for a Strength check to see whether the character can wrench
the lever into place. The GM sets the DC for any such check based on the
difficulty of the task.</p>
<p>Characters can also damage objects with their weapons and spells.
Objects are immune to poison and psychic damage, but otherwise they can
be affected by physical and magical attacks much like creatures can. The
GM determines an object’s Armor Class and hit points, and might decide
that certain objects have resistance or immunity to certain kinds of
attacks. (It’s hard to cut a rope with a club, for example.) Objects
always fail Strength and Dexterity saving throws, and they are immune to
effects that require other saves. When an object drops to 0 hit points,
it breaks.</p>
<p>A character can also attempt a Strength check to break an object. The
GM sets the DC for any such check.</p>
<h1 id="resting">Resting</h1>
<p>Heroic though they might be, adventurers can’t spend every hour of
the day in the thick of exploration, social interaction, and combat.
They need rest-time to sleep and eat, tend their wounds, refresh their
minds and spirits for spellcasting, and brace themselves for further
adventure.</p>
<h2 id="rest">Rest</h2>
<p>A rest is a period of extended downtime, at least 8 hours long,
during which a character sleeps for at least 6 hours and performs no
more than 2 hours of light activity, such as reading, talking, eating,
or standing watch. If the rest is interrupted by a period of strenuous
activity-at least 1 hour of walking, fighting, casting spells, or
similar adventuring activity-the characters must begin the rest again to
gain any benefit from it.</p>
<p>At the end of a rest, the player rolls all of their hit die and adds
the character’s Constitution modifier to it. The character regains hit
points equal to the total (minimum of 0).</p>
<p>A character can’t benefit from more than one long rest in a 24-hour
period, and a character must have at least 1 hit point at the start of
the rest to gain its benefits.</p>
<h1 id="between-adventures">Between Adventures</h1>
<p>Between trips to dungeons and battles against ancient evils,
adventurers need time to rest, recuperate, and prepare for their next
adventure. Many adventurers also use this time to perform other tasks,
such as crafting arms and armor, performing research, or spending their
hard-earned gold.</p>
<p>In some cases, the passage of time is something that occurs with
little fanfare or description. When starting a new adventure, the GM
might simply declare that a certain amount of time has passed and allow
you to describe in general terms what your character has been doing. At
other times, the GM might want to keep track of just how much time is
passing as events beyond your perception stay in motion.</p>
<h2 id="lifestyle-expenses-1">Lifestyle Expenses</h2>
<p>Between adventures, you choose a particular quality of life and pay
the cost of maintaining that lifestyle.</p>
<p>Living a particular lifestyle doesn’t have a huge effect on your
character, but your lifestyle can affect the way other individuals and
groups react to you. For example, when you lead an aristocratic
lifestyle, it might be easier for you to influence the nobles of the
city than if you live in poverty.</p>
<h2 id="downtime-activities">Downtime Activities</h2>
<p>Between adventures, the GM might ask you what your character is doing
during his or her downtime. Periods of downtime can vary in duration,
but each downtime activity requires a certain number of days to complete
before you gain any benefit, and at least 8 hours of each day must be
spent on the downtime activity for the day to count. The days do not
need to be consecutive. If you have more than the minimum amount of days
to spend, you can keep doing the same thing for a longer period of time,
or switch to a new downtime activity.</p>
<p>Downtime activities other than the ones presented below are possible.
If you want your character to spend his or her downtime performing an
activity not covered here, discuss it with your GM.</p>
<h3 id="crafting">Crafting</h3>
<p>You can craft nonmagical objects, including adventuring equipment and
works of art. You must be proficient with tools related to the object
you are trying to create (typically artisan’s tools). You might also
need access to special materials or locations necessary to create it.
For example, someone proficient with smith’s tools needs a forge in
order to craft a sword or suit of armor.</p>
<p>For every day of downtime you spend crafting, you can craft one or
more items with a total market value not exceeding 5 gp, and you must
expend raw materials worth half the total market value. If something you
want to craft has a market value greater than 5 gp, you make progress
every day in 5 gp increments until you reach the market value of the
item. For example, a suit of plate armor (market value 1,500 gp) takes
300 days to craft by yourself.</p>
<p>Multiple characters can combine their efforts toward the crafting of
a single item, provided that the characters all have proficiency with
the requisite tools and are working together in the same place. Each
character contributes 5 gp worth of effort for every day spent helping
to craft the item. For example, three characters with the requisite tool
proficiency and the proper facilities can craft a suit of plate armor in
100 days, at a total cost of 750 gp.</p>
<p>While crafting, you can maintain a modest lifestyle without having to
pay 1 gp per day, or a comfortable lifestyle at half the normal
cost.</p>
<h3 id="practicing-a-profession">Practicing a Profession</h3>
<p>You can work between adventures, allowing you to maintain a modest
lifestyle without having to pay 1 gp per day. This benefit lasts as long
you continue to practice your profession.</p>
<p>If you are a member of an organization that can provide gainful
employment, such as a temple or a thieves’ guild, you earn enough to
support a comfortable lifestyle instead.</p>
<p>If you have proficiency in the Performance skill and put your
performance skill to use during your downtime, you earn enough to
support a wealthy lifestyle instead.</p>
<h3 id="recuperating">Recuperating</h3>
<p>You can use downtime between adventures to recover from a
debilitating injury, disease, or poison.</p>
<p>After three days of downtime spent recuperating, you can make a DC 15
Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, you can choose one of
the following results:</p>
<ul>
<li>End one effect on you that prevents you from regaining hit
points.</li>
<li>For the next 24 hours, gain advantage on saving throws against one
disease or poison currently affecting you.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="researching">Researching</h3>
<p>The time between adventures is a great chance to perform research,
gaining insight into mysteries that have unfurled over the course of the
campaign. Research can include poring over dusty tomes and crumbling
scrolls in a library or buying drinks for the locals to pry rumors and
gossip from their lips.</p>
<p>When you begin your research, the GM determines whether the
information is available, how many days of downtime it will take to find
it, and whether there are any restrictions on your research (such as
needing to seek out a specific individual, tome, or location). The GM
might also require you to make one or more ability checks, such as an
Intelligence (Investigation) check to find clues pointing toward the
information you seek, or a Charisma (Persuasion) check to secure
someone’s aid. Once those conditions are met, you learn the information
if it is available.</p>
<p>For each day of research, you must spend 1 gp to cover your expenses.
This cost is in addition to your normal lifestyle expenses.</p>
<h3 id="training">Training</h3>
<p>You can spend time between adventures learning a new language or
training with a set of tools. Your GM might allow additional training
options.</p>
<p>First, you must find an instructor willing to teach you. The GM
determines how long it takes, and whether one or more ability checks are
required.</p>
<p>The training lasts for 250 days and costs 1 gp per day. After you
spend the requisite amount of time and money, you learn the new language
or gain proficiency with the new tool. # COMBAT</p>
<p>A typical combat encounter is a clash between two sides, a flurry of
weapon swings, feints, parries, footwork, and spellcasting. The game
organizes the chaos of combat into a cycle of rounds and turns. A
<strong>round</strong> represents about 6 seconds in the game world.
During a round, each participant in a battle takes a
<strong>turn</strong>. The order of turns is determined at the beginning
of a combat encounter, when everyone rolls initiative. Once everyone has
taken a turn, the fight continues to the next round if neither side has
defeated the other.</p>
<blockquote>
<h1 id="combat-step-by-step">Combat Step by Step</h1>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Determine surprise.</strong> The GM determines whether
anyone involved in the combat encounter is surprised.</li>
<li><strong>Establish positions.</strong> The GM decides where all the
characters and monsters are located. Given the adventurers’ marching
order or their stated positions in the room or other location, the GM
figures out where the adversaries are, how far away and in what
direction.</li>
<li><strong>Roll initiative.</strong> Everyone involved in the combat
encounter rolls initiative, determining the order of combatants’
turns.</li>
<li><strong>Take turns.</strong> Each participant in the battle takes a
turn in initiative order.</li>
<li><strong>Begin the next round.</strong> When everyone involved in the
combat has had a turn, the round ends. Repeat step 4 until the fighting
stops.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="surprise">Surprise</h2>
<p>A band of adventurers sneaks up on a bandit camp, springing from the
trees to attack them. A gelatinous cube glides down a dungeon passage,
unnoticed by the adventurers until the cube engulfs one of them. In
these situations, one side of the battle gains surprise over the
other.</p>
<p>The GM determines who might be surprised. If neither side tries to be
stealthy, they automatically notice each other. Otherwise, the GM
compares the Dexterity (Stealth) checks of anyone hiding with the
passive Wisdom (Perception) score of each creature on the opposing side.
Any character or monster that doesn’t notice a threat is surprised at
the start of the encounter.</p>
<p>If you’re surprised, you can’t move or take an action on your first
turn of the combat, and you can’t take a reaction until that turn ends.
A member of a group can be surprised even if the other members
aren’t.</p>
<h2 id="initiative-1">Initiative</h2>
<p>Initiative determines the order of turns during combat. When combat
starts, every participant makes a Dexterity check to determine their
place in the initiative order. The GM makes one roll for an entire group
of identical creatures, so each member of the group acts at the same
time.</p>
<p>The GM ranks the combatants in order from the one with the highest
Dexterity check total to the one with the lowest. This is the order
(called the initiative order) in which they act during each round. The
initiative order remains the same from round to round.</p>
<p>If a tie occurs, the GM decides the order among tied GM-controlled
creatures, and the players decide the order among their tied characters.
The GM can decide the order if the tie is between a monster and a player
character. Optionally, the GM can have the tied characters and monsters
each roll a d20 to determine the order, highest roll going first.</p>
<h2 id="your-turn">Your Turn</h2>
<p>On your turn, you can <strong>move</strong> a distance up to your
speed and <strong>take one action</strong>. You decide whether to move
first or take your action first. Your speed- sometimes called your
walking speed-is noted on your character sheet.</p>
<p>The most common actions you can take are described in the “Actions in
Combat” section later in this chapter. Many class features and other
abilities provide additional options for your action.</p>
<p>The “Movement and Position” section later in this chapter gives the
rules for your move.</p>
<p>You can forgo moving, taking an action, or doing anything at all on
your turn. If you can’t decide what to do on your turn, consider taking
the Dodge or Ready action, as described in “Actions in Combat.”</p>
<h2 id="bonus-actions">Bonus Actions</h2>
<p>Various class features, spells, and other abilities let you take an
additional action on your turn called a bonus action. The Cunning Action
feature, for example, allows a rogue to take a bonus action. You can
take a bonus action only when a special ability, spell, or other feature
of the game states that you can do something as a bonus action. You
otherwise don’t have a bonus action to take.</p>
<p>You can take only one bonus action on your turn, so you must choose
which bonus action to use when you have more than one available.</p>
<p>You choose when to take a bonus action during your turn, unless the
bonus action’s timing is specified, and anything that deprives you of
your ability to take actions also prevents you from taking a bonus
action.</p>
<h2 id="other-activity-on-your-turn">Other Activity on Your Turn</h2>
<p>Your turn can include a variety of flourishes that require neither
your action nor your move.</p>
<p>You can communicate however you are able, through brief utterances
and gestures, as you take your turn.</p>
<p>You can also interact with one object or feature of the environment
for free, during either your move or your action. For example, you could
open a door during your move as you stride toward a foe, or you could
draw your weapon as part of the same action you use to attack.</p>
<p>If you want to interact with a second object, you need to use your
action. Some magic items and other special objects always require an
action to use, as stated in their descriptions.</p>
<p>The GM might require you to use an action for any of these activities
when it needs special care or when it presents an unusual obstacle. For
instance, the GM could reasonably expect you to use an action to open a
stuck door or turn a crank to lower a drawbridge.</p>
<h1 id="reactions">Reactions</h1>
<p>Certain special abilities, spells, and situations allow you to take a
special action called a reaction. A reaction is an instant response to a
trigger of some kind, which can occur on your turn or on someone else’s.
The opportunity attack, described later in this chapter, is the most
common type of reaction.</p>
<p>When you take a reaction, you can’t take another one until the start
of your next turn. If the reaction interrupts another creature’s turn,
that creature can continue its turn right after the reaction.</p>
<h1 id="movement-and-position">Movement and Position</h1>
<p>In combat, characters and monsters are in constant motion, often
using movement and position to gain the upper hand.</p>
<p>On your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed. You can use
as much or as little of your speed as you like on your turn, following
the rules here.</p>
<p>Your movement can include jumping, climbing, and swimming. These
different modes of movement can be combined with walking, or they can
constitute your entire move. However you’re moving, you deduct the
distance of each part of your move from your speed until it is used up
or until you are done moving.</p>
<h2 id="breaking-up-your-move">Breaking Up Your Move</h2>
<p>You can break up your movement on your turn, using some of your speed
before and after your action. For example, if you have a speed of 30
feet, you can move 10 feet, take your action, and then move 20 feet.</p>
<h3 id="moving-between-attacks">Moving between Attacks</h3>
<p>If you take an action that includes more than one weapon attack, you
can break up your movement even further by moving between those attacks.
For example, a fighter who can make two attacks with the Extra Attack
feature and who has a speed of 25 feet could move 10 feet, make an
attack, move 15 feet, and then attack again.</p>
<h3 id="using-different-speeds">Using Different Speeds</h3>
<p>If you have more than one speed, such as your walking speed and a
flying speed, you can switch back and forth between your speeds during
your move. Whenever you switch, subtract the distance you’ve already
moved from the new speed. The result determines how much farther you can
move. If the result is 0 or less, you can’t use the new speed during the
current move.</p>
<p>For example, if you have a speed of 30 and a flying speed of 60
because a wizard cast the <em>fly</em> spell on you, you could fly 20
feet, then walk 10 feet, and then leap into the air to fly 30 feet
more.</p>
<h2 id="difficult-terrain-1">Difficult Terrain</h2>
<p>Combat rarely takes place in bare rooms or on featureless plains.
Boulder-strewn caverns, briar-choked forests, treacherous staircases-the
setting of a typical fight contains difficult terrain.</p>
<p>Every foot of movement in difficult terrain costs 1 extra foot. This
rule is true even if multiple things in a space count as difficult
terrain.</p>
<p>Low furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, snow, and shallow
bogs are examples of difficult terrain. The space of another creature,
whether hostile or not, also counts as difficult terrain.</p>
<h2 id="being-prone">Being Prone</h2>
<p>Combatants often find themselves lying on the ground, either because
they are knocked down or because they throw themselves down. In the
game, they are prone, a condition described in appendix A.</p>
<p>You can <strong>drop prone</strong> without using any of your speed.
<strong>Standing up</strong> takes more effort; doing so costs an amount
of movement equal to half your speed. For example, if your speed is 30
feet, you must spend</p>
<p>15 feet of movement to stand up. You can’t stand up if you don’t have
enough movement left or if your speed is 0.</p>
<p>To move while prone, you must <strong>crawl</strong> or use magic
such as teleportation. Every foot of movement while crawling costs 1
extra foot. Crawling 1 foot in difficult terrain, therefore, costs 3
feet of movement.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Interacting with Objects Around You</strong></p>
<p>Here are a few examples of the sorts of thing you can do in tandem
with your movement and action:</p>
<ul>
<li>draw or sheathe a sword</li>
<li>open or close a door</li>
<li>withdraw a potion from your backpack</li>
<li>pick up a dropped axe</li>
<li>take a bauble from a table</li>
<li>remove a ring from your finger</li>
<li>stuff some food into your mouth</li>
<li>plant a banner in the ground</li>
<li>fish a few coins from your belt pouch</li>
<li>drink all the ale in a flagon</li>
<li>throw a lever or a switch</li>
<li>pull a torch from a sconce</li>
<li>take a book from a shelf you can reach</li>
<li>extinguish a small flame</li>

<h2 id="moving-around-other-creatures">Moving Around Other
Creatures</h2>
<p>You can move through a nonhostile creature’s space. In contrast, you
can move through a hostile creature’s space only if the creature is at
least two sizes larger or smaller than you. Remember that another
creature’s space is difficult terrain for you.</p>
<p>Whether a creature is a friend or an enemy, you can’t willingly end
your move in its space.</p>
<p>If you leave a hostile creature’s reach during your move, you provoke
an opportunity attack, as explained later in the chapter.</p>
<h2 id="flying-movement">Flying Movement</h2>
<p>Flying creatures enjoy many benefits of mobility, but they must also
deal with the danger of falling. If a flying creature is knocked prone,
has its speed reduced to 0, or is otherwise deprived of the ability to
move, the creature falls, unless it has the ability to hover or it is
being held aloft by magic, such as by the <em>fly</em> spell.</p>
<h2 id="creature-size">Creature Size</h2>
<p>Each creature takes up a different amount of space. The Size
Categories table shows how much space a creature of a particular size
controls in combat. Objects sometimes use the same size categories.</p>
<p><strong>Table- Creature Size</strong></p>

<h3 id="space">Space</h3>
<p>A creature’s space is the area in feet that it effectively controls
in combat, not an expression of its physical dimensions. A typical
Medium creature isn’t 5 feet wide, for example, but it does control a
space that wide. If a Medium hobgoblin stands in a 5-foot wide doorway,
other creatures can’t get through unless the hobgoblin lets them.</p>
<p>A creature’s space also reflects the area it needs to fight
effectively. For that reason, there’s a limit to the number of creatures
that can surround another creature in combat. Assuming Medium
combatants, eight creatures can fit in a 5-foot radius around another
one.</p>
<p>Because larger creatures take up more space, fewer of them can
surround a creature. If four Large creatures crowd around a Medium or
smaller one, there’s little room for anyone else. In contrast, as many
as twenty Medium creatures can surround a Gargantuan one.</p>
<h4 id="squeezing-into-a-smaller-space">Squeezing into a Smaller
Space</h4>
<p>A creature can squeeze through a space that is large enough for a
creature one size smaller than it. Thus, a Large creature can squeeze
through a passage that’s only 5 feet wide. While squeezing through a
space, a creature must spend 1 extra foot for every foot it moves there,
and it has disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws.
Attack rolls against the creature have advantage while it’s in the
smaller space.</p>
<h1 id="actions-in-combat">Actions in Combat</h1>
<p>When you take your action on your turn, you can take one of the
actions presented here, an action you gained from your class or a
special feature, or an action that you improvise. Many monsters have
action options of their own in their stat blocks.</p>
<p>When you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the rules, the
GM tells you whether that action is possible and what kind of roll you
need to make, if any, to determine success or failure.</p>
<h2 id="attack">Attack</h2>
<p>The most common action to take in combat is the Attack action,
whether you are swinging a sword, firing an arrow from a bow, or
brawling with your fists.</p>
<p>With this action, you make one melee or ranged attack. See the
“Making an Attack” section for the rules that govern attacks.</p>
<p>Certain features, such as the Extra Attack feature of the fighter,
allow you to make more than one attack with this action.</p>
<h2 id="cast-a-spell">Cast a Spell</h2>
<p>Spellcasters such as wizards and clerics, as well as many monsters,
have access to spells and can use them to great effect in combat. Each
spell has a casting time, which specifies whether the caster must use an
action, a reaction, minutes, or even hours to cast the spell. Casting a
spell is, therefore, not necessarily an action. Most spells do have a
casting time of 1 action, so a spellcaster often uses his or her action
in combat to cast such a spell.</p>
<h2 id="dash">Dash</h2>
<p>When you take the Dash action, you gain extra movement for the
current turn. The increase equals your speed, after applying any
modifiers. With a speed of 30 feet, for example, you can move up to 60
feet on your turn if you dash.</p>
<p>Any increase or decrease to your speed changes this additional
movement by the same amount. If your speed of 30 feet is reduced to 15
feet, for instance, you can move up to 30 feet this turn if you
dash.</p>
<h2 id="disengage">Disengage</h2>
<p>If you take the Disengage action, your movement doesn’t provoke
opportunity attacks for the rest of the turn.</p>
<h2 id="dodge">Dodge</h2>
<p>When you take the Dodge action, you focus entirely on avoiding
attacks. Until the start of your next turn, any attack roll made against
you has disadvantage if you can see the attacker, and you make Dexterity
saving throws with advantage. You lose this benefit if you are
incapacitated (as explained in appendix A) or if your speed drops to
0.</p>
<h2 id="help">Help</h2>
<p>You can lend your aid to another creature in the completion of a
task. When you take the Help action, the creature you aid gains
advantage on the next ability check it makes to perform the task you are
helping with, provided that it makes the check before the start of your
next turn.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can aid a friendly creature in attacking a
creature within 5 feet of you. You feint, distract the target, or in
some other way team up to make your ally’s attack more effective. If
your ally attacks the target before your next turn, the first attack
roll is made with advantage.</p>
<h2 id="hide">Hide</h2>
<p>When you take the Hide action, you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check
in an attempt to hide, following the rules for hiding. If you succeed,
you gain certain benefits, as described in the “Unseen Attackers and
Targets” section later in this chapter.</p>
<h2 id="ready">Ready</h2>
<p>Sometimes you want to get the jump on a foe or wait for a particular
circumstance before you act. To do so, you can take the Ready action on
your turn, which lets you act using your reaction before the start of
your next turn.</p>
<p>First, you decide what perceivable circumstance will trigger your
reaction. Then, you choose the action you will take in response to that
trigger, or you choose to move up to your speed in response to it.
Examples include “If the cultist steps on the trapdoor, I’ll pull the
lever that opens it,” and “If the goblin steps next to me, I move
away.”</p>
<p>When the trigger occurs, you can either take your reaction right
after the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger. Remember that you can
take only one reaction per round.</p>
<p>When you ready a spell, you cast it as normal but hold its energy,
which you release with your reaction when the trigger occurs. To be
readied, a spell must have a casting time of 1 action, and holding onto
the spell’s magic requires concentration. If your concentration is
broken, the spell dissipates without taking effect. For example, if you
are concentrating on the <em>web</em> spell and ready <em>magic
missile</em>, your <em>web</em> spell ends, and if you take damage
before you release <em>magic missile</em> with your reaction, your
concentration might be broken.</p>
<h2 id="search">Search</h2>
<p>When you take the Search action, you devote your attention to finding
something. Depending on the nature of your search, the GM might have you
make a Wisdom (Perception) check or an Intelligence (Investigation)
check.</p>
<h2 id="use-an-object">Use an Object</h2>
<p>You normally interact with an object while doing something else, such
as when you draw a sword as part of an attack. When an object requires
your action for its use, you take the Use an Object action. This action
is also useful when you want to interact with more than one object on
your turn.</p>
<h1 id="making-an-attack">Making an Attack</h1>
<p>Whether you’re striking with a melee weapon, firing a weapon at
range, or making an attack roll as part of a spell, an attack has a
simple structure.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Choose a target</strong>. Pick a target within your attack’s
<strong>Range:</strong> a creature, an object, or a location.</li>
<li><strong>Determine modifiers</strong>. The GM determines whether the
target has cover and whether you have advantage or disadvantage against
the target. In addition, spells, special abilities, and other effects
can apply penalties or bonuses to your attack roll.</li>
<li><strong>Resolve the attack</strong>. You make the attack roll. On a
hit, you roll damage, unless the particular attack has rules that
specify otherwise. Some attacks cause special effects in addition to or
instead of damage.</li>
</ul>
<p>If there’s ever any question whether something you’re doing counts as
an attack, the rule is simple: if you’re making an attack roll, you’re
making an attack.</p>
<h2 id="attack-rolls">Attack Rolls</h2>
<p>When you make an attack, your attack roll determines whether the
attack hits or misses. To make an attack roll, roll a d20 and add the
appropriate modifiers. If the total of the roll plus modifiers equals or
exceeds the target’s Armor Class (AC), the attack hits. The AC of a
character is determined at character creation, whereas the AC of a
monster is in its stat block.</p>
<h3 id="modifiers-to-the-roll">Modifiers to the Roll</h3>
<p>When a character makes an attack roll, the two most common modifiers
to the roll are an ability modifier and the character’s proficiency
bonus. When a monster makes an attack roll, it uses whatever modifier is
provided in its stat block.</p>
<p><strong><em>Ability Modifier.</em></strong> The ability modifier used
for a melee weapon attack is Strength, and the ability modifier used for
a ranged weapon attack is Dexterity. Weapons that have the finesse or
thrown property break this rule.</p>
<p>Some spells also require an attack roll. The ability modifier used
for a spell attack depends on the spellcasting ability of the
spellcaster.</p>
<p><strong><em>Proficiency Bonus.</em></strong> You add your proficiency
bonus to your attack roll when you attack using a weapon with which you
have proficiency, as well as when you attack with a spell.</p>
<h3 id="rolling-1-or-20">Rolling 1 or 20</h3>
<p>Sometimes fate blesses or curses a combatant, causing the novice to
hit and the veteran to miss.</p>
<p>If the d20 roll for an attack is a 20, the attack hits regardless of
any modifiers or the target’s AC. This is called a critical hit, which
is explained later in this chapter.</p>
<p>If the d20 roll for an attack is a 1, the attack misses regardless of
any modifiers or the target’s AC.</p>
<h2 id="unseen-attackers-and-targets">Unseen Attackers and Targets</h2>
<p>Combatants often try to escape their foes’ notice by hiding, casting
the invisibility spell, or lurking in darkness.</p>
<p>When you attack a target that you can’t see, you have disadvantage on
the attack roll. This is true whether you’re guessing the target’s
location or you’re targeting a creature you can hear but not see. If the
target isn’t in the location you targeted, you automatically miss, but
the GM typically just says that the attack missed, not whether you
guessed the target’s location correctly.</p>
<p>When a creature can’t see you, you have advantage on attack rolls
against it. If you are hidden-both unseen and unheard-when you make an
attack, you give away your location when the attack hits or misses.</p>
<h2 id="ranged-attacks">Ranged Attacks</h2>
<p>When you make a ranged attack, you fire a bow or a crossbow, hurl a
handaxe, or otherwise send projectiles to strike a foe at a distance. A
monster might shoot spines from its tail. Many spells also involve
making a ranged attack.</p>
<h3 id="range">Range</h3>
<p>You can make ranged attacks only against targets within a specified
range.</p>
<p>If a ranged attack, such as one made with a spell, has a single
range, you can’t attack a target beyond this range.</p>
<p>Some ranged attacks, such as those made with a longbow or a shortbow,
have two ranges. The smaller number is the normal range, and the larger
number is the long range. Your attack roll has disadvantage when your
target is beyond normal range, and you can’t attack a target beyond the
long range.</p>
<h3 id="ranged-attacks-in-close-combat">Ranged Attacks in Close
Combat</h3>
<p>Aiming a ranged attack is more difficult when a foe is next to you.
When you make a ranged attack with a weapon, a spell, or some other
means, you have disadvantage on the attack roll if you are within 5 feet
of a hostile creature who can see you and who isn’t incapacitated.</p>
<h2 id="melee-attacks">Melee Attacks</h2>
<p>Used in hand-to-hand combat, a melee attack allows you to attack a
foe within your reach. A melee attack typically uses a handheld weapon
such as a sword, a warhammer, or an axe. A typical monster makes a melee
attack when it strikes with its claws, horns, teeth, tentacles, or other
body part. A few spells also involve making a melee attack.</p>
<p>Most creatures have a 5-foot <strong>reach</strong> and can thus
attack targets within 5 feet of them when making a melee attack. Certain
creatures (typically those larger than Medium) have melee attacks with a
greater reach than 5 feet, as noted in their descriptions.</p>
<p>Instead of using a weapon to make a melee weapon attack, you can use
an <strong>unarmed strike</strong>: a punch, kick, head-butt, or similar
forceful blow (none of which count as weapons). On a hit, an unarmed
strike deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1 + your Strength modifier. You
are proficient with your unarmed strikes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Contests in Combat</em></strong></p>
<p>Battle often involves pitting your prowess against that of your foe.
Such a challenge is represented by a contest. This section includes the
most common contests that require an action in combat: grappling and
shoving a creature. The GM can use these contests as models for
improvising others.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="opportunity-attacks">Opportunity Attacks</h4>
<p>In a fight, everyone is constantly watching for a chance to strike an
enemy who is fleeing or passing by. Such a strike is called an
opportunity attack.</p>
<p>You can make an opportunity attack when a hostile creature that you
can see moves out of your reach. To make the opportunity attack, you use
your reaction to make one melee attack against the provoking creature.
The attack occurs right before the creature leaves your reach.</p>
<p>You can avoid provoking an opportunity attack by taking the Disengage
action. You also don’t provoke an opportunity attack when you teleport
or when someone or something moves you without using your movement,
action, or reaction. For example, you don’t provoke an opportunity
attack if an explosion hurls you out of a foe’s reach or if gravity
causes you to fall past an enemy.</p>
<h3 id="two-weapon-fighting-1">Two-Weapon Fighting</h3>
<p>When you take the Attack action and attack with a light melee weapon
that you’re holding in one hand, you can use a bonus action to attack
with a different light melee weapon that you’re holding in the other
hand. You don’t add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus
attack, unless that modifier is negative.</p>
<p>If either weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon,
instead of making a melee attack with it.</p>
<h3 id="grappling">Grappling</h3>
<p>When you want to grab a creature or wrestle with it, you can use the
Attack action to make a special melee attack, a grapple. If you’re able
to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces
one of them.</p>
<p>The target of your grapple must be no more than one size larger than
you and must be within your reach. Using at least one free hand, you try
to seize the target by making a grapple check instead of an attack roll:
a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target’s Strength
(Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the
ability to use). You succeed automatically if the target is
incapacitated. If you succeed, you subject the target to the grappled
condition (see appendix ##). The condition specifies the things that end
it, and you can release the target whenever you like (no action
required).</p>
<p><strong><em>Escaping a Grapple</em></strong>. A grappled creature can
use its action to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength
(Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by your Strength
(Athletics) check.</p>
<p><strong><em>Moving a Grappled Creature</em></strong>. When you move,
you can drag or carry the grappled creature with you, but your speed is
halved, unless the creature is two or more sizes smaller than you.</p>
<h3 id="shoving-a-creature">Shoving a Creature</h3>
<p>Using the Attack action, you can make a special melee attack to shove
a creature, either to knock it prone or push it away from you. If you’re
able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack
replaces one of them.</p>
<p>The target must be no more than one size larger than you and must be
within your reach. Instead of making an attack roll, you make a Strength
(Athletics) check contested by the target’s Strength (Athletics) or
Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use).
You succeed automatically if the target is incapacitated. If you
succeed, you either knock the target prone or push it 5 feet away from
you.</p>
<h2 id="cover">Cover</h2>
<p>Walls, trees, creatures, and other obstacles can provide cover during
combat, making a target more difficult to harm. A target can benefit
from cover only when an attack or other effect originates on the
opposite side of the cover.</p>
<p>There are three degrees of cover. If a target is behind multiple
sources of cover, only the most protective degree of cover applies; the
degrees aren’t added together. For example, if a target is behind a
creature that gives half cover and a tree trunk that gives
three-quarters cover, the target has three-quarters cover.</p>
<p>A target with <strong>half cover</strong> has a +2 bonus to AC and
Dexterity saving throws. A target has half cover if an obstacle blocks
at least half of its body. The obstacle might be a low wall, a large
piece of furniture, a narrow tree trunk, or a creature, whether that
creature is an enemy or a friend.</p>
<p>A target with <strong>three-quarters cover</strong> has a +5 bonus to
AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has three-quarters cover if
about three-quarters of it is covered by an obstacle. The obstacle might
be a portcullis, an arrow slit, or a thick tree trunk.</p>
<p>A target with <strong>total cover</strong> can’t be targeted directly
by an attack or a spell, although some spells can reach such a target by
including it in an area of effect. A target has total cover if it is
completely concealed by an obstacle.</p>
<h2 id="damage-and-healing">Damage and Healing</h2>
<p>Injury and the risk of death are constant companions of those who
explore fantasy gaming worlds. The thrust of a sword, a well-placed
arrow, or a blast of flame from a <em>fireball</em> spell all have the
potential to damage, or even kill, the hardiest of creatures.</p>
<h3 id="hit-points-4">Hit Points</h3>
<p>Hit points represent a combination of physical and mental durability,
the will to live, and luck. Creatures with more hit points are more
difficult to kill. Those with fewer hit points are more fragile.</p>
<p>A creature’s current hit points (usually just called hit points) can
be any number from the creature’s hit point maximum down to 0. This
number changes frequently as a creature takes damage or receives
healing.</p>
<p>Whenever a creature takes damage, that damage is subtracted from its
hit points. The loss of hit points has no effect on a creature’s
capabilities until the creature drops to 0 hit points.</p>
<h3 id="damage-rolls">Damage Rolls</h3>
<p>Each weapon, spell, and harmful monster ability specifies the damage
it deals. You roll the damage die or dice, add any modifiers, and apply
the damage to your target. Magic weapons, special abilities, and other
factors can grant a bonus to damage. With a penalty, it is possible to
deal 0 damage, but never negative damage.</p>
<p>When attacking with a <strong>weapon</strong>, you add your ability
modifier-the same modifier used for the attack roll-to the damage. A
<strong>spell</strong> tells you which dice to roll for damage and
whether to add any modifiers.</p>
<p>If a spell or other effect deals damage to <strong>more than one
target</strong> at the same time, roll the damage once for all of them.
For example, when a wizard casts <em>fireball</em> or a cleric casts
<em>flame strike</em>, the spell’s damage is rolled once for all
creatures caught in the blast.</p>
<h3 id="critical-hits">Critical Hits</h3>
<p>When you score a critical hit, you get to roll extra dice for the
attack’s damage against the target. Roll all of the attack’s damage dice
twice and add them together. Then add any relevant modifiers as normal.
To speed up play, you can roll all the damage dice at once.</p>
<p>For example, if you score a critical hit with a dagger, roll 2d4 for
the damage, rather than 1d4, and then add your relevant ability
modifier. If the attack involves other damage dice, such as from the
rogue’s Sneak Attack feature, you roll those dice twice as well.</p>
<h3 id="damage-types">Damage Types</h3>
<p>Different attacks, damaging spells, and other harmful effects deal
different types of damage. Damage types have no rules of their own, but
other rules, such as damage resistance, rely on the types.</p>
<p>The damage types follow, with examples to help a GM assign a damage
type to a new effect.</p>
<p><strong><em>Acid</em></strong>. The corrosive spray of a black
dragon’s breath and the dissolving enzymes secreted by a black pudding
deal acid damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Bludgeoning</em></strong>. Blunt force attacks-hammers,
falling, constriction, and the like-deal bludgeoning damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Cold</em></strong>. The infernal chill radiating from an
ice devil’s spear and the frigid blast of a white dragon’s breath deal
cold damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Fire</em></strong>. Red dragons breathe fire, and many
spells conjure flames to deal fire damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Force</em></strong>. Force is pure magical energy focused
into a damaging form. Most effects that deal force damage are spells,
including <em>magic missile</em> and <em>spiritual weapon</em>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Lightning</em></strong>. A <em>lightning bolt</em> spell
and a blue dragon’s breath deal lightning damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Necrotic</em></strong>. Necrotic damage, dealt by certain
undead and a spell such as <em>chill touch</em>, withers matter and even
the soul.</p>
<p><strong><em>Piercing</em></strong>. Puncturing and impaling attacks,
including spears and monsters’ bites, deal piercing damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Poison</em></strong>. Venomous stings and the toxic gas
of a green dragon’s breath deal poison damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Psychic</em></strong>. Mental abilities such as a mind
flayer’s psionic blast deal psychic damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Radiant</em></strong>. Radiant damage, dealt by a
cleric’s <em>flame strike</em> spell or an angel’s smiting weapon, sears
the flesh like fire and overloads the spirit with power.</p>
<p><strong><em>Slashing</em></strong>. Swords, axes, and monsters’ claws
deal slashing damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Thunder</em></strong>. A concussive burst of sound, such
as the effect of the <em>thunderwave</em> spell, deals thunder
damage.</p>
<h3 id="damage-resistance-and-vulnerability">Damage Resistance and
Vulnerability</h3>
<p>Some creatures and objects are exceedingly difficult or unusually
easy to hurt with certain types of damage.</p>
<p>If a creature or an object has <strong>resistance</strong> to a
damage type, damage of that type is halved against it. If a creature or
an object has <strong>vulnerability</strong> to a damage type, damage of
that type is doubled against it.</p>
<p>Resistance and then vulnerability are applied after all other
modifiers to damage. For example, a creature has resistance to
bludgeoning damage and is hit by an attack that deals 25 bludgeoning
damage. The creature is also within a magical aura that reduces all
damage by 5. The 25 damage is first reduced by 5 and then halved, so the
creature takes 10 damage.</p>
<p>Multiple instances of resistance or vulnerability that affect the
same damage type count as only one instance. For example, if a creature
has resistance to fire damage as well as resistance to all nonmagical
damage, the damage of a nonmagical fire is reduced by half against the
creature, not reduced by three-quarters.</p>
<h3 id="healing">Healing</h3>
<p>Unless it results in death, damage isn’t permanent. Even death is
reversible through powerful magic. Rest can restore a creature’s hit
points, and magical methods such as a <em>cure wounds</em> spell or a
<em>potion of healing</em> can remove damage in an instant.</p>
<p>When a creature receives healing of any kind, hit points regained are
added to its current hit points. A creature’s hit points can’t exceed
its hit point maximum, so any hit points regained in excess of this
number are lost. For example, a druid grants a ranger 8 hit points of
healing. If the ranger has 14 current hit points and has a hit point
maximum of 20, the ranger regains 6 hit points from the druid, not
8.</p>
<p>A creature that has died can’t regain hit points until magic such as
the <em>revivify</em> spell has restored it to life.</p>
<h3 id="dropping-to-0-hit-points">Dropping to 0 Hit Points</h3>
<p>When you drop to 0 hit points, you either die outright or fall
unconscious, as explained in the following sections.</p>
<h3 id="instant-death">Instant Death</h3>
<p>Massive damage can kill you instantly. When damage reduces you to 0
hit points and there is damage remaining, you die if the remaining
damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum.</p>
<p>For example, a cleric with a maximum of 12 hit points currently has 6
hit points. If she takes 18 damage from an attack, she is reduced to 0
hit points, but 12 damage remains. Because the remaining damage equals
her hit point maximum, the cleric dies.</p>
<h3 id="falling-unconscious">Falling Unconscious</h3>
<p>If damage reduces you to 0 hit points and fails to kill you, you fall
unconscious (see appendix ##). This unconsciousness ends if you regain
any hit points.</p>
<h3 id="death-saving-throws">Death Saving Throws</h3>
<p>Whenever you start your turn with 0 hit points, you must make a
special saving throw, called a death saving throw, to determine whether
you creep closer to death or hang onto life. Unlike other saving throws,
this one isn’t tied to any ability score. You are in the hands of fate
now, aided only by spells and features that improve your chances of
succeeding on a saving throw.</p>
<p>Roll a d20. If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you
fail. A success or failure has no effect by itself. On your third
success, you become stable (see below). On your third failure, you die.
The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of
both until you collect three of a kind. The number of both is reset to
zero when you regain any hit points or become stable.</p>
<p><strong><em>Rolling 1 or 20</em></strong>. When you make a death
saving throw and roll a 1 on the d20, it counts as two failures. If you
roll a 20 on the d20, you regain 1 hit point.</p>
<p><strong><em>Damage at 0 Hit Points</em></strong>. If you take any
damage while you have 0 hit points, you suffer a death saving throw
failure. If the damage is from a critical hit, you suffer two failures
instead. If the damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum, you
suffer instant death.</p>
<h4 id="stabilizing-a-creature">Stabilizing a Creature</h4>
<p>The best way to save a creature with 0 hit points is to heal it. If
healing is unavailable, the creature can at least be stabilized so that
it isn’t killed by a failed death saving throw.</p>
<p>You can use your action to administer first aid to an unconscious
creature and attempt to stabilize it, which requires a successful DC 10
Wisdom (Medicine) check.</p>
<p>A <strong>stable</strong> creature doesn’t make death saving throws,
even though it has 0 hit points, but it does remain unconscious. The
creature stops being stable, and must start making death saving throws
again, if it takes any damage. A stable creature that isn’t healed
regains 1 hit point after 1d4 hours.</p>
<h3 id="monsters-and-death">Monsters and Death</h3>
<p>Most GMs have a monster die the instant it drops to 0 hit points,
rather than having it fall unconscious and make death saving throws.</p>
<p>Mighty villains and special nonplayer characters are common
exceptions; the GM might have them fall unconscious and follow the same
rules as player characters.</p>
<h2 id="knocking-a-creature-out">Knocking a Creature Out</h2>
<p>Sometimes an attacker wants to incapacitate a foe, rather than deal a
killing blow. When an attacker reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a
melee attack, the attacker can knock the creature out. The attacker can
make this choice the instant the damage is dealt. The creature falls
unconscious and is stable.</p>
<h2 id="temporary-hit-points">Temporary Hit Points</h2>
<p>Some spells and special abilities confer temporary hit points to a
creature. Temporary hit points aren’t actual hit points; they are a
buffer against damage, a pool of hit points that protect you from
injury.</p>
<p>When you have temporary hit points and take damage, the temporary hit
points are lost first, and any leftover damage carries over to your
normal hit points. For example, if you have 5 temporary hit points and
take 7 damage, you lose the temporary hit points and then take 2
damage.</p>
<p>Because temporary hit points are separate from your actual hit
points, they can exceed your hit point maximum. A character can,
therefore, be at full hit points and receive temporary hit points.</p>
<p>Healing can’t restore temporary hit points, and they can’t be added
together. If you have temporary hit points and receive more of them, you
decide whether to keep the ones you have or to gain the new ones. For
example, if a spell grants you 12 temporary hit points when you already
have 10, you can have 12 or 10, not 22.</p>
<p>If you have 0 hit points, receiving temporary hit points doesn’t
restore you to consciousness or stabilize you. They can still absorb
damage directed at you while you’re in that state, but only true healing
can save you.</p>
<p>Unless a feature that grants you temporary hit points has a duration,
they last until they’re depleted or you finish a rest.</p>
<h1 id="mounted-combat">Mounted Combat</h1>
<p>A knight charging into battle on a warhorse, a wizard casting spells
from the back of a griffon, or a cleric soaring through the sky on a
pegasus all enjoy the benefits of speed and mobility that a mount can
provide.</p>
<p>A willing creature that is at least one size larger than you and that
has an appropriate anatomy can serve as a mount, using the following
rules.</p>
<h2 id="mounting-and-dismounting">Mounting and Dismounting</h2>
<p>Once during your move, you can mount a creature that is within 5 feet
of you or dismount. Doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half
your speed. For example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15
feet of movement to mount a horse. Therefore, you can’t mount it if you
don’t have 15 feet of movement left or if your speed is 0.</p>
<p>If an effect moves your mount against its will while you’re on it,
you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall off the
mount, landing prone in a space within 5 feet of it. If you’re knocked
prone while mounted, you must make the same saving throw.</p>
<p>If your mount is knocked prone, you can use your reaction to dismount
it as it falls and land on your feet. Otherwise, you are dismounted and
fall prone in a space within 5 feet it.</p>
<h2 id="controlling-a-mount">Controlling a Mount</h2>
<p>While you’re mounted, you have two options. You can either control
the mount or allow it to act independently. Intelligent creatures, such
as dragons, act independently.</p>
<p>You can control a mount only if it has been trained to accept a
rider. Domesticated horses, donkeys, and similar creatures are assumed
to have such training. The initiative of a controlled mount changes to
match yours when you mount it. It moves as you direct it, and it has
only three action options: Dash, Disengage, and Dodge. A controlled
mount can move and act even on the turn that you mount it.</p>
<p>An independent mount retains its place in the initiative order.
Bearing a rider puts no restrictions on the actions the mount can take,
and it moves and acts as it wishes. It might flee from combat, rush to
attack and devour a badly injured foe, or otherwise act against your
wishes.</p>
<p>In either case, if the mount provokes an opportunity attack while
you’re on it, the attacker can target you or the mount.</p>
<h1 id="underwater-combat">Underwater Combat</h1>
<p>When adventurers pursue sahuagin back to their undersea homes, fight
off sharks in an ancient shipwreck, or find themselves in a flooded
dungeon room, they must fight in a challenging environment. Underwater
the following rules apply.</p>
<p>When making a <strong>melee weapon attack</strong>, a creature that
doesn’t have a swimming speed (either natural or granted by magic) has
disadvantage on the attack roll unless the weapon is a dagger, javelin,
shortsword, spear, or trident.</p>
<p>A <strong>ranged weapon attack</strong> automatically misses a target
beyond the weapon’s normal range. Even against a target within normal
range, the attack roll has disadvantage unless the weapon is a crossbow,
a net, or a weapon that is thrown like a javelin (including a spear,
trident, or dart).</p>
<p>Creatures and objects that are fully immersed in water have
resistance to fire damage. ## License</p>
