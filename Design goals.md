### Design goals

The main focus should be to firstly **REMOVE content**, second **CHANGE mechanics** and lastly **ADD procedures**.

The document should end up with less stuff than what we started with.

#### Removals

- [X] Races cut back.
- [X] Classes have been cut back to Cleric, Figther and Wizard. The variety should come from the lived experiences of the characters and the stuff they pick up before they perish.
- [X] Cleric and wizard spells go no higher than 6th-level.
- [X] Remove Inspiration.
- [X] Remove Multiclassing.
- [X] Remove Feats.
- [X] Slim down Alignment.
- [X] Slim down Languages.
- [X] Remove single spell Concentration restriction.
- [X] Remove planes.
- [X] Remove variant encumbrance.
- [X] Remove madness.
- [X] Remove pantheons.
- [] Remove spell focus. Material components are always needed if stated.

#### Changes

- [X] Mixed together long and short rest only leaving "rest".
- [X] Cantrips have been turned into 1st-level spells.
- [X] Darkvision have been changed limited to not allow the visibility of fine details.
- [X] Replace stock Backgrounds with barebones Backgrounds.

#### Additions

- [] Implement morale (DMG p. 273)
- [] Implement retainers/followers (Loyalty DMG p. 93, Sidekicks from either Essentials Kit or Tashas?)
- [] Implement strongholds (DMG p. 127-128)
- [] XP to Gold should be the standard and Training (DMG p. 131) is required.
